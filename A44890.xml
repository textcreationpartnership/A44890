            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE AUTHOR's PREFACE.</head>
            <p>SOME Perſons of Honour and Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, whom I ought by no
means to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige, having engaged me to write ſomething upon Trade, which
might give them a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Idea of it as it regards Politicks: I belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
nothing would better anſwer that End, than to give them a true Notion of the
Trade of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> which has diffuſed it ſelf over all Parts of
the habitable World, and to ſhew that it is on Account of Trade that their
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick has ſuch a conſiderable Rank amongſt the States of
<hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was what moved me to undertake this ſmall Treatiſe; and
indeed I write the more willingly on this Subject of Commerce, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there
is nothing, in my Judgment, ſeems to be ſo little underſtood in
<hi>France,</hi> eſpecially by Perſons in publick Employments and high
Poſts, either in the Courts of Judicature, the <pb n="ii" facs="tcp:56197:3"/>Cabinet, or
the Treaſury. However, it is certain, Commerce is of ſo great Importance,
that I make no Difficulty to aver, that according to the preſent Conduct of
the ſeveral States of <hi>Europe,</hi> there are very few things in
Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment which deſerve more our Attention than this Article of
Commerce.</p>
            <p>To be convinced of this Truth, we have nothing elſe to do, but
conſider the Difference there is between thoſe Countries where Trade
flouriſhes, and thoſe Countries who have none. If we will only remember,
that <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> which (by Reaſon of their
Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) make ſo great a Figure in the Affairs of <hi>Europe,</hi>
regulate their principal Intereſt always with an Eye to their Commerce; and
this was the principal Motive which cauſed the laſt Wars; (that is, the
Security of their Trade,) we ſhall be entirely ſatisfied, that Commerce
ought to have no mean Place in modern Politicks.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe Conſiderations (which are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ones in
relation to the preſent State of <hi>Europe</hi>) there are yet others more
general, which ought no leſs to excite all Princes and their Miniſters, and
all thoſe who have any Share in Government, to know thoroughly the Nature of
Commerce, and the Maxims which are neceſſary to its being well carried on
and managed; ſince (as <hi>Bocalin</hi> very well obſerves) Agriculture and
Commerce are the <pb n="iii" facs="tcp:56197:3"/>Breaſts which ſuckle and nouriſh the
State; Truths which ought to be engraven in Letters of Gold in all the
Apartments of Kings, Princes and Stateſmen, to induce them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
Tradeſmen and Merchants according to their Merits. To theſe I ſhall add,
that a great State cannot flouriſh, or indeed be at Peace, if it has not a
great Trade; for 'tis only by means of Trade it can draw to its ſelf Riches
and Plenty, without which it can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake nothing advantageous, either to aid
and aſſiſt its Allies, or extend its Limits. The great <hi>Guſtavus
Adolphus</hi> was ſo well convinc'd of this Truth, that tho' War was his
predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant Paſſion, yet he very ſeriouſly apply'd himſelf to make
Trade flouriſh in his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and was uſed to ſay, <hi>That to put
his Soldiers Valour to the Proof, he was often obliged to have recourſe to
his Merchants.</hi> My Lord <hi>Bacon,</hi> who was one of the greateſt
Politicians of his time, look'd upon Merchants to be ſo neceſſary, that
he compared them in the State, to the Blood in a Man's Body, <hi>Which if it
did not flouriſh,</hi> ſays he, <hi>a Man may poſſibly have ſome of
his Limbs very ſtrong, but he would be ſure to have empty Veins and a lean
Habit of Body. Qui niſi flouruerit, poteſt quidem aliquos-Artus habere
Robuſtos, ſed Venas vacuas &amp; Habitum Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poris macrum.</hi> It may be
proved from Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples almoſt as old as the World, that States 
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:56197:4"/>flouriſh in Proportion to Commerce; as we may gather from
what the Holy Scriptures teach us, in relation to the <hi>Tyrians</hi> and
<hi>Sido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians:</hi> But we need not run ſo far back into Antiquity for
Examples; we need only conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſurprizing Changes which Trade has
cauſed in our Days (if I may ſo ſay) amongſt our Neighbours.</p>
            <p>The Power of <hi>England</hi> was once ſo incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable,
before the Reign of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> according to <hi>Cambden</hi>'s
Obſervation, that her Predeceſſors (nay even her own Father) when they
had a mind to put a Fleet to Sea, were obliged to hire Ships from <hi>Hamburgh,
Lubeck, Dantzick, Genoa</hi> and <hi>Venice:</hi> But after the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> by the Care of that able Princeſs, apply'd themſelves
to Traffick, and by reaſon of the great Protection ſhe gave to Merchants,
it flouriſhed in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> in all the Dominions of the Grand
Seignior, upon the Coaſts of <hi>Africa,</hi> the <hi>Eaſt</hi> (or rather
the <hi>Weſt</hi>) <hi>Indies,</hi> and in almoſt all other Parts of the
World; that Queen ſoon became capable of maintaining her ſelf a great Naval
Force, which at laſt became the Terror of the Ocean and the Narrow Seas,
which made that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion go and attack, more than once, the Power of
<hi>Philip</hi> the Second, not only in the New World, but even on the very
Coaſts of <hi>Spain.</hi> In ſhort, that powerful Queen followed ſo well
thoſe Maxims of ſecuring and encreaſing <pb n="v" facs="tcp:56197:4"/>the Commerce of
all her Subjects, and their Traffick on the footing of her Naval Force, that
ſhe laid thoſe ſolid Foundations for the encreaſe of Commerce and
Maritime Power of <hi>England,</hi> two things to which that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion owes to
this Day all its Strength and Grandeur.</p>
            <p>But nothing can come up to what the <hi>Dutch</hi> have done by
Commerce; and it will ever be a Subject of Aſtoniſhment and Wonder, that a
handful of Merchants, that fled into a little Country which produced ſcarce
enough to ſubſiſt its new Inhabitants, ſhould beat down the exorbitant
Power of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy, and make that King ſue for Peace;
that they ſhould lay the Foundation of ſo mighty a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick, which we
ſee at preſent in ſome man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to hold the Balance between all the other
Powers of <hi>Europe;</hi> but what is moſt wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and what ought moſt
to ſurprize us, is, that the Wars never interrupted their Trade, and that it
was in the very heat of War that they laid the Foundations of that of the
<hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> and the Coaſts of <hi>Africa;</hi> and that they
ſhould trade with their Enemies, the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> in ſpite of all
the Precautions they took to the contrary, which very much contributed to the
Support of the War.</p>
            <p>The States General of the <hi>United Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> ſeeing the
Induſtry of theſe Merchants was of ſo great Service to the Republick,
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:56197:5"/>and favoured them in every thing; and it may be
truly ſaid, that without their Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance they would never have been
able to put ſo glorious an End to the War as they did. We ſee by this what
Advantage Commerce is to a State, when it is regulated with Prudence, and by
able Merchants, who have all Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and no Conſtraint.</p>
            <p>But what need we go out of <hi>France</hi> for Examples, to ſhow
how important Commerce is to a Nation: We need only conſider the great Things
that have been done under the glorious Reign of our Great Monarch, and the
almoſt infinite Sums which have been diſbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as well to ſupport the
War againſt all the Powers of <hi>Europe</hi> for above 30 Years, as du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Peace. Could one ever have imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this could have been done, without
that prodigious Quantity of Money, which Trade, eſpecially that with
<hi>Spain,</hi> brought into <hi>France?</hi> For we have no Mines to ſupply
us. What then would have been the Conſequence, had Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce been protected
and encouraged in <hi>France</hi> as it ought to have been? I doubt not but in
ſuch Caſe we might have ſaid of <hi>France,</hi> what the Holy Scripture
ſaid of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that <hi>in the Days of</hi> Solomon <hi>Gold
and Silver were as common as Stones:</hi> If <hi>England,</hi> by means of the
Woollen Manufactures, and by the vent of her Tin, Lead, and Sea-Coal, has
amaſſed ſuch Riches, what might one not have <pb n="vii" facs="tcp:56197:5"/>believed
<hi>France</hi> would have gained; which, beſides her Manufactures of Wool,
Silk, Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen, Hats, Paper, and many other Things, which are eagerly ſought
after by all the World, ſupplies other Countries with Wines, Brandies, Wheat,
Salt, Oil, and Fruits of all ſorts, for immenſe Sums. This Abundance and
great Plenty of our Merchandize, ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and uſeful to our
Neighbours, made my Lord <hi>Bellaſis</hi> ſay, <hi>That if God ſhould
one Day make the</hi> Turks <hi>know what they could do at Sea, and the</hi>
French <hi>how far they might extend their Commerce, all</hi> Europe <hi>would
ſoon fall a Conqueſt to thoſe Powers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall only give one Inſtance more, to ſhew how nothing but
Commerce can enrich a Kingdom; let us therefore turn our Eyes to
<hi>Spain,</hi> and it is certain, that there is no Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the World has
ſo little Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver as the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> tho' thoſe two Metals
grow in ſuch prodigious Quantities in their Dominions; other Nations,
notwithſtanding, are better provided therewith, on account of the great Vent
their Commodities have in <hi>Spain,</hi> and the dependent Kingdoms, which
have Occaſion for them; and, in ſhort, that great Monarchy has fallen to
Decay, purely for having neglected Commerce, and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeveral
Manufactures in Dominions of ſo vaſt and large extent. It was this
Negligence which was one of the principal Springs of <pb n="viii" facs="tcp:56197:6"/>the
Riches of <hi>France;</hi> and while <hi>France</hi> tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with
<hi>Spain,</hi> ſhe never wanted Gold or Silver, not even during thoſe long
and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Wars. Let us only look back and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what Condition
<hi>France</hi> was in by the <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renean</hi> Treaty, notwithſtanding a
long War of above twenty five Years, and all thoſe ſhe has ſince
ſuſtained, even to our Days. It is much to be wiſhed, we would open our
Eyes ſoon enough, and take Notice of a Matter of ſo much Importance, and
ſo neceſſary as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, and endeavour to know how to take ſuch
Meaſures as may bring to a good Iſſue that, on which, in ſome manner,
depends the Happineſs of all his Majeſty's Subjects, and the Grandeur of
the Nation.</p>
            <p>We <hi>Frenchmen</hi> have been reproached (and perhaps not
without ſome reaſon) that the Genius of our Nation was not proper for a
foreign Commerce, being quickly weary of all Undertakings that require a
ſolid and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Application. But without deciding this Matter, I ſhall
content my ſelf to ſay, that there have been, and yet are in
<hi>France,</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of very good Abilities and Experience,
neceſſary for carrying on a vaſt Trade: Out of ſeveral, I ſhall only
mention <hi>Jaques Couer,</hi> Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendent of the Finances, or (in the
Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of thoſe Times) Moneyer to King <hi>Charles</hi> the Seventh. This
Man, who was born at <hi>Bourges,</hi> being entirely addicted to 
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:56197:6"/>Foreign Trade, in a time when ſcarce any one meddled with
it in <hi>France,</hi> got prodigious Wealth, which he employ'd to the beſt
Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in the Service of the King his Maſter, and the Support of the
State. <hi>Matthew Coucy</hi> an Hiſtorian, his Contemporary, ſpeaks of him
after this manner: 
<q rend="inline">'The King <hi>(ſays he)</hi> had in his Kingdom
a Man of mean Extraction, whoſe Name was <hi>Jaques Couer,</hi> who by his
Senſe, Vigilance, and good Conduct, ſo ordered it, as to undertake trading
in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of the highteſt Value, which he ſtill continued to do,
notwithſtanding his being made Moneyer to King <hi>Charles,</hi> in which
Office he continued a long while in great Power and Proſperity: He had under
him many Clerks and Factors, who had the Care of theſe Commodities, to
diſtribute them thro' all Chriſtian States and Kingdoms. He had at Sea a
great many large Veſſels, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained at his own Expence and Charge, which
traded to the <hi>Levant, Egypt</hi> and <hi>Barbary,</hi> to freight
themſelves with all ſorts of rich and fine Commodities and Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, by
Leave of the Sultan and Turks, paying them ſome little Duty as an
Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment. He cauſed to be brought from thoſe Countries, Gold and
Silver Stuffs, Silks of all Sorts and Colours, Furs for Men and Women of
ſeveral Kinds; as Martins and Sables, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and other excellent
Curioſities, <pb n="x" facs="tcp:56197:7"/>which Goods he ſold by his Commiſſaries
and Factors at the <hi>Hotel Royalle,</hi> in all the principal Cities of the
Kingdom, and in fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Courts, where the People, ſurprized with Admiration,
ſoon bought them up at a good Price. He had at leaſt three or four Hundred
Commiſſaries or Factors at his Command, and gained himſelf more in one
Year, than all the Merchants of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. He was in Poſſeſſion of
the Office of Superintendant of the Finances, when King <hi>Charles</hi>
undertook the Conqueſt of <hi>Normandy</hi> in the Year 1449; of which
Conqueſt this famous Merchant was the chief Cauſe; for he was the firſt
that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged the King to that great Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and furniſhed him with
an Army, by offering him ſeveral Milions, which was executed after the
Manners as the King beſt liked, and for which he was highly applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and
complimented by all the Princes and Lords of the Court; and yet for all that
Expence, his Wealth was almoſt inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>Heaven could once have given us, and yet might have given us
another <hi>Jaquez Couer,</hi> and then we ſhould have entertained greater
Hopes than ever to bring the Trade of <hi>France</hi> to its higheſt Pitch,
and make our Nation the moſt flouriſhng in the World. The Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of
<hi>France,</hi> to accompliſh this, want <pb n="xi" facs="tcp:56197:7"/>only an
experienced Leader; a Perſon of much Knowledge, one that has a great
Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight, an enterprizing Genius, and continual Application and
Perſeverance; a Perſon of great Credit and Power, that he may protect
thoſe who traffick under him, and are his Commiſſioners, in whatever
Place of the World.</p>
            <p>It was by ſuch Means as theſe, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> have
carried Commerce to the higheſt Degree, as may be ſeen in the following
Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs, which I deſire thoſe who will give themſelves the trouble to
read, would not think to be the ſimple Speculation of a Man of Letters, but
the true Sentiments of the moſt able Merchants of <hi>Holland,</hi> whom one
ought ever to look upon as the true Oracles of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce; it was amongſt them
chiefly that I learned what I know of this rich and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Subject; and I
ſeriouſly declare, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having ſeen the Greatneſs of their
Trade, and the conſiderable Influence that this famous Republick has had for
many Years paſt in all the Affairs of <hi>Europe,</hi> I was entirely
convinc'd, that Commerce is one of the principal Parts of Policy, which made me
reſolved to ſtudy very ſeriouſly an Affair, to which before I apply'd
my ſelf out of pure Curioſity: In ſhort, I reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be inſtructed
as much as poſſible, not only in the Trade of <hi>Holland,</hi> but alſo
in that of the <hi>Engliſh, Portugueze</hi> and other Nations; and I was the
more invited to this, becauſe it <pb n="xii" facs="tcp:56197:8"/>is very viſible that
we have failed very much in our Projects of Commerce, in not well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and
conſidering the Nature of that of our Neighbours; ſeveral Voyages, that I
have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily made to ſeveral Parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> have much contributed
to make me know their way of Trade, having had the Happineſs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
with Perſons of the greateſt Ability where I have been. Beſides, I have
ſpared no Pains or Coſt to have good Memoirs, and the following Treatiſe
will be a ſufficient Proof of what I ſay.</p>
            <p>Theſe various and rare Truths, which I have with much Pains and
Expence acquired the Knowledge of, gave me Courage to put them into Writing,
and treat of a Subject ſo little underſtood. If I find theſe Memoirs are
well received, I may be induced to make conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Additions, and
preſent the World with others relating to the Commerce of other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

            <head>CHAP. I. What Condition the Trade of <hi>Europe</hi> was in from
the Year 1000, to the End of the last Century, that it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt entirely
managed, and carried on by the <hi>Dutch.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE preſent Trade of this powerful Republick being formed out of
<hi>that</hi> of many Nations, it will not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper briefly to obſerve
the ſeveral Changes the Trade or Commerce of <hi>Europe</hi> underwent, and
on what Footing it ſtood, at the time the <hi>Dutch</hi> began to form
themſelves into a Common-Wealth.</p>
            <p>It is about Six Hundred Years ago, that Trade, which was almoſt
ruined by thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual <pb n="2" facs="tcp:56197:11"/>Wars that troubled
<hi>Europe,</hi> began to revive and flouriſh under the <hi>Italians</hi> and
<hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi> The former of theſe, after the Ruine of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Empire, went into the <hi>Levant</hi> for Spices, Druggs, Silks, and all the
other valuable Commodities thoſe Eaſtern Climes produced, to diſpoſe
of, and ſell them again in all Parts of <hi>Europe. Alexandria,</hi> and
ſome other Ports of <hi>Syria,</hi> were the Places where this Trade was
principally carried on, and which were ſupplied from time to time, with all
theſe Sorts of Commodities, by the <hi>Aſiaticks,</hi> both by Land and
Sea, and by the <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Arabians,</hi> by means of the Red
Sea; and this was the conſtant Practice both of <hi>Greeks</hi> and
<hi>Romans,</hi> eſpecially ſince the Reign of <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomy</hi> ſurnamed
<hi>Philadelphus,</hi> as I have elſewhere dicourſed of more at large, in
my Treatiſe <hi>Of the Commerce of the Ancients.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Italians</hi> having added to their <hi>Levant</hi> Trade
the Manufactures of Silk which the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Europe</hi> were very fond
of, made ſuch conſiderable Progreſs therein, as to lay up im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe
Riches, by means of which they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med thoſe powerful Republicks, ſome of
which ſubſiſt to this very Day, with great Splendour and Magnificence,
the happy Effects of their ancient, and long eſtabliſhed Commerce.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Italian</hi> Trade however, properly ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, was only
what remained of that which the <hi>Romans</hi> formerly drove with
<hi>Aſia,</hi> but that <pb n="3" facs="tcp:56197:11"/>of <hi>Germany</hi> owed its
Riſe entirely to the <hi>Italians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Towards the End of the twelfth Century, the Towns of
<hi>Germany</hi> ſituated on the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea, and thoſe great
Rivers that run into it, were famous for their trading all over the
neighbouring Provinces; but as this Trade was often diſturbed by Pirates, and
thoſe fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Wars that at that time troubled the North, they united
themſelves together for their mutual Defence, to ſecure and protect their
Commerce, from what might diſturb, or annoy it for the future. Theſe Towns
thus united, and which increaſed to about 72, or thereabouts, were called
<hi>Hanſe Towns,</hi> from the <hi>German</hi> Word <hi>Amſee,</hi> or
<hi>Anſee,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>upon the Sea,</hi> and their
Inhabitants called <hi>Oſterlins,</hi> that is, <hi>Eaſterlings,</hi> Names
afterwards very well known all over <hi>Europe;</hi> and theſe Towns for a
long while commanded all the Trade and Navigation of the North, which at that
time were almoſt entirely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the other People of <hi>Europe,</hi>
except the <hi>Italians.</hi> Theſe things made them ſo powerful, that for
a long time they were the ſole Arbiters of Peace and War, all over the North.
But this Trade, which was for two Centuries ſucceſſively the moſt
flouriſhing that ever was, began to decay about the Year 1500, on Account of
their falling out with one another, and of which mutual Diviſions the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> made ſuch conſiderable 
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56197:12"/>Advantage (eſpecially the latter) that it fell almoſt
entirely into their Hands, and has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſo ever ſince,
notwithſtanding all the vigorous Efforts theſe <hi>Hanſe</hi> Towns have
made from time to time, to retrieve it. So true it is, that when Commerce has
once changed its Courſe, it is the moſt difficult thing in the World to
bring it back again.</p>
            <p>By this one may ſee the State and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Trade of
<hi>Europe,</hi> during the laſt Age, and how it was divided between the
<hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>Germans.</hi> But the <hi>Portugueze,</hi> towards
the End of the Fifteenth Century, having found out a new Paſſage to the
<hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> by the <hi>Cape of Good Hope,</hi> all the Trade which
the <hi>Venetians</hi> drove to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> for Spices, and
other Commodities of the Eaſt, ſoon fell into their Hands; ſo that
<hi>Lisbon</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the chief Magazine, or Store-Houſe, for theſe
Goods, whence the reſt of all <hi>Europe</hi> might be conveniently
furniſhed and ſupplyed. Soon after the <hi>Portugueze</hi> made the
Diſcovery of the <hi>Eaſt Indies, Cadiz</hi> and <hi>Seville</hi> were full
of all the rich and valuable Commodities the new World (or <hi>America</hi>)
produced. Gold and Silver growing more common in <hi>Europe,</hi> and
Navigation every Day coming to a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Perfection, Trade grew more lively
and flouriſhing, and from that time all Nations in <hi>Europe</hi> ſtrove
to trade with the <hi>Portugueze</hi> 
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:56197:12"/>and
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> whom they looked upon as the ſole Maſters of Gold and
Silver.</p>
            <p>The Commodities of the North were found of extream Neceſſity to
the People of <hi>Europe,</hi> who lived towards the South; for beſides Wheat
and other Grain, they had from thence other Commodities, as Materials proper
for building Ships, Navigation, and the like; and the People of the North, on
the other Hand, ſtood as much in need of the Commodities of the South, as
Wine, Salt, Oil, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But then the Voyage from the <hi>Baltick</hi>
to the <hi>Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean,</hi> being very long, and full of Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
(which yet have ſince been found not to be inſuperable) the advantageous
and happy Situation of the Ports of <hi>Flanders</hi> between the North and the
South; the Manufacturies of Linnen and Woollen Cloth, which flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in
thoſe Parts ſince the tenth Century, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the free Fairs of
theſe Towns, tempted the Merchants both of the North and South to ſet up
their Store-Houſes, or Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines for Goods, at <hi>Bruges,</hi> and
afterwards at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> by means of which the Exchange of Goods with
each other, was carried on with greater Eaſe and Conveniency, and Half the
Expence and Trouble of the Voyage en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely ſaved.</p>
            <p>The great Trade and Manufactures of the Low Countries made
<hi>Antwerp</hi> indiſputably the moſt conſiderable Town in the World for
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56197:13"/>Wealth and Commerce: But as the Trade of
<hi>Amſterdam</hi> is entirely owing to the Ruin of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> it will
not be amiſs to look a little farther back, the better to diſcover the true
Origin of the Commerce and Manufactures of the Low Countries, which were once
ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous throughout the whole World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caeſar</hi> obſerves in his Commentaries, that the People of
the Low Countries were very laborious and induſtrious, both for Invention and
Imitation. His Words are, <hi>Eſt ſummae genus ſolertiae, atque ad ad
omnia imitanda quae a quoquo traduntur aptiſſimum.</hi> Lib. 7. Theſe
People always were, and are to this very Day, the ſame as they were in
<hi>Caeſar</hi>'s time; and it muſt be own'd, that they have brought the
Art of Weaving to its higheſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, not to mention ſeveral others
for which the World is indebted to them. It is ſaid the <hi>Flemings</hi>
were the firſt of the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern People that made all Sorts of Woollen and
Linnen Cloths, their Country yielding the fineſt Flax in the World, and
<hi>England</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the moſt excellent and beſt of Wooll.
<hi>Baldwin</hi> ſurnamed the <hi>Young,</hi> Count of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
contributed very much to the Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Subjects Commerce, by
ſetting up about the Year 960, free Fairs in ſeveral Towns of his
Dominions, which drew thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vaſt Numbers from the neighbouring Provinces,
who came to furniſh themſelves <pb n="7" facs="tcp:56197:13"/>with theſe Commodities,
and indeed they dealt for vaſt Quantities, there being no Duty, or Cuſtom
to be paid for any Goods exported thence. This Woollen and Linnen Trade, which
at firſt began in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> very much encreaſed
for three Centuries; du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all which time nothing was more flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
than the Trade of <hi>Flanders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Succeſſors of <hi>Baldwin</hi> having laid ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Duties, or Cuſtoms, on theſe free Fairs, and the <hi>Flemiſh</hi>
Manufactures, to raiſe Money in order to defray the Expences they were at, in
ſeveral Wars with <hi>France,</hi> was the real Cauſe that the Woolen and
Linnen Cloth-Workers, whoſe Numbers were almoſt infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, made ſeveral
cruel Inſurrections in <hi>Ghent,</hi> in the Year 1301. And others of
theſe Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who lived in the open Country, finding but little Shelter
there in War time, went away in great Numbers to <hi>Tillemont</hi> and
<hi>Louvain,</hi> from whence they diſperſed afterwards into ſeveral
Parts of <hi>Brabant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Dukes of <hi>Brabant,</hi> one would have imagined, might have
taken Warning by the ill Conduct of the <hi>Flemings,</hi> which was atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with ſo many Inconveniencies; but on the contrary, they took the very ſame
Meaſures, and in their Turn, laid ſeveral Duties upon Manufactures, which
likewiſe cauſed Inſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in ſeveral Places of <hi>Brabant,</hi>
particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly at <hi>Louvain,</hi> where the Cloth-Workers <pb n="8" facs="tcp:56197:14"/>having killed ſeveral Magiſtrates, to eſcape unpuniſhed, fled
ſome of them into <hi>England,</hi> and others into <hi>Holland.</hi> Thoſe
who got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>England,</hi> gave the <hi>Engliſh</hi> the firſt
Inſight into Cloth Making, and ſhewed them how to work their own Wooll, to
the great Detriment of the Trade of the Low Countries; for it is certain, that
to the Year 1404, and even ſince the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſold their Wooll to
the <hi>Flemings,</hi> and took their Cloths in Payment.</p>
            <p>Not only the Cloth-Workers of <hi>Brabant</hi> went into
<hi>Holland,</hi> but a great many from <hi>Flanders</hi> did the ſame, and
ſettled chiefly at <hi>Leyden,</hi> where that Art of Cloth-Working hath
continued ever ſince, to ſhine out in its full Luſtre.</p>
            <p>Thus we plainly ſee, how laying on too high Duties was what
removed good Part of the Manufacturies of <hi>Flanders</hi> into
<hi>Brabant,</hi> and from that Province into thoſe beyond the
<hi>Maeſe,</hi> and into <hi>England,</hi> where they have raiſed the
Woollen Manufacture to the higheſt Degree of Perfection it can poſſibly
admit of.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> being very deſirous to
keep to themſelves theſe important and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable Manufacturies, took
particular Care not to burden them with too heavy Cuſtoms, or Taxes. We
ſhall explain in another Place the Reaſon of this their wiſe Policy and
Conduct.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:56197:14"/>About the Year 1400, the Art of Salting, or
Pickling of Herrings, was found out by a <hi>Fleming</hi> of <hi>Pierulem,</hi>
which much encouraged this Sort of Fiſhery, as being of very great Advantage,
and together with the Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, made Navigation flouriſh in that large
Province, and of Conſequence very much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed their Trade and Commerce.
The Towns of <hi>Sluice</hi> and <hi>Bruges</hi> were the two chief Places
where the <hi>Flemings</hi> at that Time drove on the Herring-Trade with
Foreigners. The former of which having a fine Harbour, both for Largeneſs of
Extent, and ſafe Riding, capable of containing 500 Ships, was conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
full of Ships from different Nations that traded there as well as at
<hi>Bruges;</hi> for, in Reality, <hi>Sluice</hi> is no more than the Port of
<hi>Bruges,</hi> which Towns have a Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with each other, by means of
a large Canal, <hi>Bruges</hi> is at preſent, one of the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt Towns in
<hi>Flanders,</hi> but has loſt much of its Splendour, ſince the Year 1487;
for at that Time, there was ſcarce a Nation in <hi>Europe,</hi> how
inconſiderable ſoever, that had not their proper Magazine, or
Store-Houſe, and a Company eſtabliſhed there for Trade; as the
<hi>Engliſh, French, Scotch, Caſtilian,</hi> and <hi>Portugueze,</hi> the
Companies of <hi>Arragon, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talonia, Biſcay, Venice, Florence, Genoa, Lucca,
Milan, Germany, Denmark, Sweden,</hi> and all the Hanſe Towns. Theſe
laſt, about <pb n="10" facs="tcp:56197:15"/>the Year 1262, ſet up in that Town their
greateſt Store-Houſe, which gave a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Encreaſe to Trade. It
was to this Place that the ſeveral Nations juſt now mentioned imported the
Commodities of their reſpective Countries, which they exchanged with each
other, or for <hi>Flanders</hi> Linnen.</p>
            <p>This mighty Trade of <hi>Bruges</hi> drew thither Workmen of all
Sorts, which made it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely rich and famous. Nothing can give us a better
Idea of the Riches of this Town, than what Hiſtory tells us of a Queen of
<hi>France,</hi> who was Conſort to <hi>Philip the Fair;</hi> who coming to
<hi>Bruges</hi> in the Year 1301, ſeeing the Women ſo richly dreſt, could
not in a Sort of Indignation forbear ſpeaking theſe Words, <hi>I thought I
had been the only Queen in this Place, but I ſee there are above Six
Hundred.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The immenſe Riches of the People of <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> on Account of
their vaſt Trade, made them not only grow inſolent and unjuſt to foreign
Merchants (ſo that they left the Place) but alſo to their Sovereign, which
was the very Ruin of their Trade, that had flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in an extraordinary
Manner to the Year 1487, when a War broke out between the <hi>Flemings</hi> and
the Arch-Duke <hi>Maximilian</hi> their Prince, which laſted about ten Years,
and expired with the Death of the Trade of <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</hi> The People of
<hi>Antwerp</hi> and <hi>Amſterdam</hi> 
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:56197:15"/>growing uneaſy
to ſee all the Trade of the Low Countries center in <hi>Bruges,</hi>
aſſiſted the Arch-Duke <hi>Maximilian</hi> in chaſtiſing that Town
for their Rebellion; and in Recompence for ſuch Aſſiſtance, obtained
from that Prince all the Privileges of Commerce formerly enjoyed by
<hi>Bruges.</hi> Thus was that Trade transferred to <hi>Antwerp</hi> and
<hi>Amſterdam,</hi> but the greateſt Share fell to <hi>Antwerp;</hi> and
every thing after ſeemed to contribute to the Encreaſe of its Commerce. The
<hi>Italians</hi> much about that time having cauſed the Uſe of Silk to be
more common in <hi>Europe,</hi> imported great Quantities to <hi>Antwerp.</hi>
The <hi>Portugueze</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> having diſcovered both
<hi>Indies,</hi> imported Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and all other the rich Commodities pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by thoſe vaſt and wealthy Climates; the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſet up a
Store-Houſe for their Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe, and the Hanſe Towns, who after the
thirteenth Century, had ſettled one of their four Magazines of Goods at
<hi>Bruges,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved it to <hi>Antwerp,</hi> where they cauſed to be
built that ſtately Town-Houſe which remains to this Day.</p>
            <p>The Perſecutions raiſed in <hi>Germany</hi> on the Account of
Religion, under the Reign of the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, in
<hi>France</hi> under <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, and in <hi>England</hi> under
Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> forced a World of People thither, as well as Trade, and
particularly encreaſed that of <hi>Antwerp.</hi> The vaſt Concourſe of
all the <pb n="12" facs="tcp:56197:16"/>principal trading Nations made this Town the moſt
celebrated Store-Houſe, or Magazine in all <hi>Europe,</hi> if not of the
whole World. In a Word, <hi>Antwerp</hi> was <hi>then,</hi> almoſt what
<hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam</hi> is <hi>now;</hi> for about the Year 1550, it was a common
thing to ſee 2500 Ships in the <hi>Scheld,</hi> laden with all Sorts of
Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe. By this it evidently appears, that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce may flouriſh in
a Monarchy, as well as in a Free State, eſpecially if good Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be not
wanting; for never any thing flouriſhed more than the Manufactures and
Commerce of the Low Countries, under the Government of four Princes of the
Houſe of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and two of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> I
lay a long while under that old vulgar Error, that Common Wealths were moſt
proper for carrying on a conſiderable Trade; but I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered my Opinion, after
I had more narrowly examined things, and heard this Matter diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed by
ſome of the ableſt Merchants and Politicians of <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Holland,</hi> and after I had ſeriouſly reflected on the happy
Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Fruitfulneſs of <hi>France,</hi> the Induſtry of its
Inhabitants, and the Nature of its Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, I was fully convinced (and I
think it would not be a hard Matter to convince others) that Commerce may be
made to flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh there, as well as in any Republick what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, and by that
Means render that Monarchy more powerful than ever it was yet.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:56197:16"/>It is certainly the Intereſt of Princes that
Commerce ſhould flouriſh in their Dominions; for never were greater things
performed by Sovereigns than when the Trade of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects has afforded
them the Means to put them in Execution, which may eaſily be proved by
infinite Examples both ancient and modern.</p>
            <p>Trade has the only attractive Quality to draw into any State, Gold
and Silver, which are the <hi>Primum Mobile</hi> of all Actions. This is ſo
true, that <hi>Spain,</hi> in whoſe Dominions theſe two Metals are produced
in greateſt Abundance, is very often ſtraitned for other Neceſſities of
Life, and that purely for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving neglected Trade and Manufactures, and all the
Mines of <hi>America</hi> would ſcarce be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to pay for all the
Merchandiſe and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions that the other Nations of <hi>Europe</hi> bring
thither.</p>
            <p>Trade (which has not any Enemy ſo mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal as Conſtraint) changed
its Reſidence as ſoon as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> began to deprive the
ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Provinces of the Low Countries of their Privileges. The
Inquiſition which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to be ſet up by the Duke of
<hi>Alva,</hi> and the Cruelty he exerciſed in governing thoſe rich
Provinces, forced ſuch infinite Numbers to leave them, that in a few Months,
above a Hundred Thouſand Families retired into other Parts. After this, the
Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the Year 1584, beſieged <hi>Antwerp,</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:56197:17"/>gave a terrible Blow to its Trade; for the <hi>Scheld</hi>
during that long Siege, being continually blocked up, the Merchants who uſed
to come and trade in that Town, went elſewhere. In ſhort, the bad Politicks
of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> compleated the Ruin of the Trade of
<hi>Antwerp,</hi> as well as of the other Towns in the Low Countries, that were
under his Juriſdiction. For the Views he had in humbling that Town whoſe
great Riches gave him Umbrage, made him, after its Reduction, neglect to keep
the <hi>Scheld</hi> open, intending by ſo doing, to leſſen its Trade, in
hopes that moſt of it would then diffuſe it ſelf over the other Towns in
the Low Countries. But his Hopes were fruſtrated: for being engaged in
almoſt continual Wars with his Neighbours and not taking due Care to free the
Seas from Rovers and Enemies, it ſo fell out, that the Towns of
<hi>Flanders,</hi> which uſed to follow the Fiſhery and Sea Trade, loſt
both, ſo far were they from getting amongſt them any Share of the Trade of
<hi>Antwerp.</hi> This made the whole Fiſhery remove to <hi>Holland,</hi> and
the Manufactures of <hi>Flanders</hi> into other Countries.</p>
            <p>One third Part of the Workmen and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, who wrought, or dealt
in Silks, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masks, Taffeties, and Stockings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> went to ſettle
in <hi>England,</hi> becauſe none in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try knew at that time to work
in thoſe Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures. A great many went to <hi>Leyden,</hi> and 
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56197:17"/>moſt of them that dealt in Linnen, went to ſettle in
<hi>Harlem,</hi> not to mention thoſe who went to <hi>Amſterdam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is aſtoniſhing to think, that the Merchants of
<hi>Antwerp,</hi> in leaving a Place the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient in the World for
Trade, ſhould make choice of one ſeeming the moſt improper in all
<hi>Europe.</hi> One would have rather thought that the Neighbourhood of
<hi>England,</hi> whoſe Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Harbours are ſo admirably fitted for
Trade, might have invited them thither.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Merchants who were of the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Religion, would have had
a greater In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to ſettle there, than in any other Place whatſoever,
in hopes not only to live more at quiet, but alſo on Account of the
Situation, which is very advantageous for trading with all <hi>Europe.</hi> But
they wanted to be in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try where Foreigners were not obliged to pay ſuch
Cuſtoms, and other Taxes, which the native <hi>Engliſh</hi> are free from;
for in <hi>England,</hi> it ſeems, at the time, Foreigners and all their
Poſterity payed double what the Natives did; beſides, Foreigners were
excluded all Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies or Societies of Trade, ſo that none were allowed to
work either as Partners, or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, unleſs at ſuch Trades as the
Natives were unacquainted with, ſo that none went thither but ſuch as
wrought in Serges, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masks, Stockings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:56197:18"/>Moſt of theſe, and the like Inconveniencies,
they were alſo ſure to meet with in the Hanſe Towns, which partly was the
Cauſe that almoſt the whole Trade of <hi>Antwerp</hi> came to be
eſtabliſhed in the Towns of <hi>Holland,</hi> which were free from all
thoſe Obſtacles. The Situation of theſe neighbouring Towns, and ſeveral
other Conſiderations contributed very much to draw thither, eſpecially to
<hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam,</hi> all this vaſt and profitable Trade.</p>
            <p>After the Union of the ſeven Provinces, and the World ſaw this
new Republick defend it ſelf with Succeſs againſt <hi>Spain,</hi> under
the Conduct of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> all thoſe who hated the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Government retired thither as to an <hi>Aſylum,</hi> from
its Rigour and Severity.</p>
            <p>The Perſecutions which <hi>Spain</hi> renewed with too great
Severity in ſeveral Places, againſt thoſe who had embraced the new
Opinions, peopled the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> with a World of excellent
Artiſans, who ſet up there ſeveral new Manufactures, and brought thoſe
they had already, to great Perfection. The Civil Wars that laſted ſo long
in <hi>France,</hi> then in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> and laſt of all in
<hi>England,</hi> augmented con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably the Inhabitants of the United
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, and the Wars which broke out in the Year 1634, in the Low
Countries, between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> made likewiſe great
Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Merchants and Workmen come into <pb n="17" facs="tcp:56197:18"/>
               <hi>Holland;</hi> for the richeſt Villages of <hi>Flanders,
Brabant,</hi> and the Country beyond the <hi>Maeſe,</hi> being ruined by
Winter Quarters, the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants themſelves left them, becauſe the moſt
trading Towns had loſt all their Commerce, and the Carriage of Goods was
liable to ſuch imminent Dangers.</p>
            <p>All this cauſed not only the Towns of <hi>Holland</hi> to grow
extraordinarily populous, but doubly encreaſed their Trade, as having a
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Vent for almoſt all Sorts of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures and other
Commodities, during the Continuance of that War.</p>
            <p>But after all, nothing has encreaſed the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of
<hi>Holland,</hi> and their Manufactures, ſo much as the <hi>French</hi>
Proteſtants, who were almoſt all of them Merchants or Artiſans, and came
thither about twenty or thirty Years ſince.</p>
            <p>To conclude, it muſt be acknowledge for inconteſtable Truth,
that whenever Trade is clogg'd or conſtrain'd in any Government, it will
retire to others where it may have grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Safety, and be more favourably
uſed, which Happineſs, at that time, it could no where find ſo well as in
<hi>Holland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having here clearly explained and obſerved the principal Motives
which induced ſo many Merchants and Artiſans, to go in Millions to the
<hi>United Provinces,</hi> let us now conſider what their Commerce is, how
they carry it on, and a Country producing nothing neceſſary to Trade 
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56197:19"/>and Navigation, is become the Centre of both: For
<hi>Holland</hi> produces nothing at all neceſſary, except Butter,
Cheeſe, and Clay to make <hi>Delft</hi> Ware, or other Eaſtern Ware, and
this is well worth the Obſervation of the Reader that is any ways verſed in
Politicks.</p>

            <head>CHAP. II. Of the Origin and Cauſes of the vaſt Trade of
<hi>Holland.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT is certain, that ſome Manufactures were ſet up in ſeveral
Places of <hi>Holland,</hi> even while the Hanſe Towns commanded all the
Trade and Navigation of <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Art of Pickling Herrings having been found out, as I before
obſerved, about 250 Years ago, and the Ruine of the Trade of <hi>Bruges</hi>
encreaſing that of <hi>Holland,</hi> tho' it was but then inconſiderable,
in Compariſon to what it was afterwards by the Deſtruction of that of
<hi>Antwerp;</hi> the prodigious Numbers of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that left the Low
Countries, together with the vaſt Riches they brought thither (not to mention
thoſe who came thither from other Countries, where Liberty of Conſcience
was not permitted) were of Neceſſity obliged to trade by Sea, to procure
for themſelves Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries for Life, the new Country they were come to
inhabit being but of ſmall Extent, and not producing near what they had an
abſolute <pb n="19" facs="tcp:56197:19"/>Occaſion for. This Barrenneſs of
<hi>Holland</hi> was one of the principal Cauſes of the great Trade we ſee
carried on there at this time; for the great, and incredible Numbers of People
who fled thither for Security, had no other Way to ſubſiſt, and to pay
thoſe heavy Taxes ſo often laid upon them, in Defence of their Liberty
againſt the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe two powerful Motives, the Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Life and
Liberty, cauſed the Inhabitants of the <hi>United Provinces</hi> to carry
their Goods to all Parts of the World, where they had any Proſpect of Gain.
About the Year 1625, they traded to the Kingdoms of the North; to <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,
Poland, Muſcovy, England,</hi> to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Low Countries, and
to <hi>Portugal,</hi> under <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Colours, or of any other Nation
in Alliance with <hi>Philip</hi> II. But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> afterwards
having by their Severities and Vexations deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the <hi>Dutch</hi> from ſo
much as attempting to trade with either of theſe two Nations, found to their
no ſmall Loſs, the fatal Conſequences of their miſtaken Politicks; for
the Seamen and Traders, who had by the Interruption of Trade with
<hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> loſt all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Employment, were
reſolved not to ſit ſtill, but hazard all, rather than live without
Trading. With this Reſolution they went to viſit the Coaſts of
<hi>America</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> and their adjacent Iſlands; at laſt,
thro' almoſt infinite Dangers, they penetrated into the Eaſt
<hi>Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:56197:20"/>By means of theſe ſeveral Voyages they got,
at firſt Hand, the greateſt Part of thoſe rich Commodities which they
before uſed to furniſh themſelves with at ſecond Hand, at
<hi>Lisbon</hi> and <hi>Seville;</hi> and their famous Eaſt <hi>India</hi>
Company, which began in the Year 1602, behaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo
dexterouſly, that they poſſeſt themſelves of the greateſt Part of
the beſt Places the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueze</hi> were Maſters of in the
<hi>Indies,</hi> and of almoſt all their Commerce too in thoſe Parts.</p>
            <p>The Truce of twelve Years being concluded in the Beginning of the
Year 1609, between the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the <hi>United Provinces,</hi>
the States General omitted nothing all that time to increaſe their Trade
where it was already eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, or to eſtabliſh it where they never
had eſtabliſhed it before.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1612, the Grand Seignior al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the <hi>Dutch</hi> a
free Trade throughout all his Dominions. This Treaty of Alliance with the
<hi>Turks,</hi> gave a free and favourable Acceſs to their Ships, all over
the <hi>Mediterranean.</hi> About that time the King of <hi>Morocco,</hi> and
the Emperour of <hi>Japan</hi> permitted them alſo to trade in all their
Dominions, ſince which this Republick might boaſt of having extended her
Commerce over all Parts of the old World, except <hi>China.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The War breaking out again in the Year 1621, between <hi>Spain</hi>
and the <hi>United Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> their Eaſt <hi>India</hi> Company
puſhed on their <pb n="21" facs="tcp:56197:20"/>Conqueſts and Commerce in the Eaſt,
with ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing Succeſs, at the Expence of <hi>Spain</hi> and
<hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal.</hi> Their Weſt <hi>India</hi> Company, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in the
Year 1623, notwithſtanding the War, beſides thoſe immenſe Sums they
gained by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Plate Fleets, and thoſe
conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Advantages they made by ruining their Men of War,
poſſeſſed themſelves of Part of <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zil,</hi> and the moſt
important Places the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueze</hi> held in <hi>Guinea,</hi> and the
other Countries of the Weſtern Coaſt of <hi>Africa;</hi> and could they but
have kept the Conqueſts they made in <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zil,</hi> 'tis highly probable
they would have been entire Maſters of it, and in a few Years would have got
into their own Hands, all the Trade of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and
<hi>Portugueze</hi> in that Place.</p>
            <p>The <hi>United Provinces</hi> having obtained of the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> very great Advantages for their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, at the Peace of
<hi>Munſter,</hi> which was concluded in the Year 1648, they puſhed it on
with the utmoſt Vigour during that Calm their Republick then enjoyed, and got
together by that means, immenſe Riches, which put them into a Condition to
ſupport the War which they had with <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> in
the Year 1672. In a Word, this famous Republick has (notwithſtanding the
Wars) extended her Trade over all Parts of the World, where ſhe has, and
ſtill does maintain it with ſuch prudent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and conſiderable
Authority, that ſhe may ſerve as a Model for all other trading Nations.</p>

            </head>
            <p>IT is certain, as I have already obſerved, that there were ſome
Manufactures eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in <hi>Holland,</hi> long before their Fiſhery,
Traffick, and Navigation; but then this was ſo inconſiderable a Matter,
that it may be truly ſaid, that the Fiſhery gave Birth to their Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
and Navigation, This was the Opinion of Monſieu <hi>De Wit,</hi> and the
moſt underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Perſons in <hi>Holland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Subjects of the <hi>United Provinces</hi> fiſh on their own
Sea Coaſts, Lakes, and Rivers, and take vaſt Quantities of Cod, Haddock,
Salmon, Soles, and other Sorts of Fiſh, and how conſiderable that Fiſhery
may be, and how great the Quantities are which they carry to foreign Countries,
yet it may truly be affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that it is ſcarce any thing in Compariſon of
their Herring Fiſhery, which in the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Holland</hi> and
<hi>Zealand</hi> employs above twenty Thouſand Men. This Fiſhing, which 
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56197:21"/>continues from Mid-ſummer Day to the 14th of
<hi>September,</hi> and from thence it holds to the 25th of <hi>November,</hi>
is chiefly on the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Coaſts of <hi>England,</hi> off of <hi>Yarmouth,
Wintertownneſs,</hi> and the River <hi>Humber.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the very Beginning of this Republick, the States General have
always uſed their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Endeavours to ſecure their Countrymen the
Herring Fiſhery. Their Regulations for that Purpoſe are wonderful, and the
Orders almoſt innumerable. They take great Care to throw all away that are
not extreamly good, and to ſalt the others in time, that the Salt be good,
and the Quantity ſufficient; that the Parcels be ſweet and clean, and have
no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Defect that may ſpoil the Fiſh. In ſhort, it muſt be
owned, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> omit nothing that may keep up the Value and
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation this Commodity has acquired by paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing through their
Hands.</p>
            <p>It ought not to be thought ſtrange, that the States General are
ſo very careful of their Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Fiſhing, and of their good Way of curing
them, ſince it is a Matter of ſo great Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as to be taken Notice
of in all their Proclamations, for the Continuance of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and the
Fiſhery.</p>
            <p>The Herring Fiſhery is the greateſt Trade, and the beſt Gold
Mine belonging to the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Provinces:</hi> This enriches ſo many
Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and employs ſo many People; this makes <pb n="24" facs="tcp:56197:22"/>them
build ſo many Ships in <hi>Holland,</hi> which they ſend to all Parts laden
with this Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity. They ſell vaſt Quantities to the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Countries, and are very often paid in ready Money; 'tis this which encreaſes
their Commerce, their Privileges, and even their Revenues.</p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>Matteren</hi> aſſures us that in the Year 1601,
in three Days time there ſailed out from <hi>Holland</hi> 1500 Buſſes to
fiſh for Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings. A Buſs is a Veſſel built on Purpoſe for this Sort
of Fiſhing, and ſome of them are from 50 to 60 Tuns.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> ſays, that in the Year 1609, the
<hi>Dutch</hi> employed on the Coaſt of <hi>England</hi> in this Fiſhery,
3000 Ships, and 15000 Men; and a <hi>Dutch</hi> Author who was employed by
Meſſieurs <hi>De Wit,</hi> tells us, that a little while before the
Province of <hi>Holland</hi> alone ſent out every Year, in time of Peace,
above 1000 Buſſes, and 150 leſſer Veſſels.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> fiſh and ſell every Year
above 300000 Tuns of Fiſh, which at 200 Florins <hi>per</hi> Tun, brings in
every Year 75 Millions of Livers, of which 52 Millions turn (as they ſay) to
the Country's Profit, and the 23 other Millions that remain, go towards
defraying the Charges of ſuch Fiſhery; ſo that if one conſiders that
all the Ships employed in Fiſhing are built in <hi>Holland;</hi> that all the
Cordage, Sails, Nets, and Barrels, are made <pb n="25" facs="tcp:56197:22"/>there, and that
they find their own Salt and Proviſions for the Subſiſtance of this great
Number of Fiſhermen, one may eaſily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, that this Employment only,
maintains an incredible Number of Men and Families, not including all thoſe
who are employed to tranſport theſe Fiſh to almoſt all the Kingdoms and
Countries of the World.</p>
            <p>Theſe Buſſes ſail generally from <hi>Dort, Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdam,
Delft, Schiedam, Vlaerdinguen,</hi> the <hi>Brill, Maeſlandſhies,
Enchuiſen,</hi> and ſome other Places of leſs Note.</p>
            <p>This Art of Pickling and Barrelling Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, as I ſaid before,
was found out by a <hi>Heming</hi> of <hi>Bierulem,</hi> whoſe Name was
<hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Buerem.</hi> He died in the Year 1347, and was buried at
<hi>Bierulem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth coming to that Town, cauſed a Tomb to
be erected to honour the Memory of that Man who had procured ſo great an
Advantage to his Country.</p>
            <p>To the Fiſhery in general may be added that of the Whale, the Oil
and Fins of which ſerve for ſeveral Uſes. They fiſh for the Whales on
the Coaſts of <hi>Greenland</hi> and <hi>Spitsburg,</hi> which is but ſeven
or eight Days Voyage with a South Wind, a thing very frequent in
<hi>Holland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whale Fiſhing is only once a Year. There ſails from
<hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and the neighbouring Towns, from the <hi>Maoſe</hi> and
<hi>Winde,</hi> above 200 Ships from 200 to 250 Tuns Burthen, 
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56197:23"/>having each 35 or 40 Men aboard to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the
Fiſhery.</p>
            <p>The largeſt Whales yield about 7 or 8 Tun of Oil: This Oil
thickens like Hogs-Lard, and they uſe great Quantities of it in the
<hi>United Provinces,</hi> eſpecially the poor and labouring People, to burn
in Lamps, and in making green Soap, a thing only in Uſe in the Low Countries,
<hi>Artois</hi> and <hi>Picardy.</hi> Thoſe that make Shammy Leather of
Bucks, Goats, Sheeps and Elks Skins, conſume great Quantities of this Oil,
which is the moſt proper for this Son of Dreſſing Leather, of any Oil
whatſoever and therefore they cannot well be without it.</p>
            <p>The Manufactures in the <hi>United Provinces</hi> employ as many
People as the Fiſhery. It is incredible how many get their Livelihood by
both. I have before obſerved, that ſome Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures were eſtabliſhed
before the Fiſhery but thoſe Manufactures were then very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
to what they were afterwards. The Herring Fiſhery in particular, was ſo
advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> that the Sale of their Fiſh brought into
their Country, from the Places where they uſed to diſpoſe of them,
ſeveral un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought Goods, which they got finiſhed at Home by thoſe vaſt
Numbers of Workmen of all Sorts, who had fled hither from <hi>Flanders,
Brabant, France, Germany,</hi> and ſeveral other Countries, on the Account of
Perſecution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:56197:23"/>I do not pretend to give an exact Particular of
all the Manufactures of the <hi>United Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;</hi> it would be too prolix
for the Brevity of this Treatiſe. I ſhall only ſay, that it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that in no Kingdom, State, or Country in the World, they are ſo numerous and
flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing, as in <hi>Holland.</hi> I ſhall take Notice only of ſome of
the moſt conſiderable, and ſuch as ſell beſt in other Countries.</p>
            <p>Tho' there are Manufactures in ſeveral Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the <hi>United
Provinces,</hi> yet they flouriſh moſt in the Towns of <hi>Amſterdam,
Leyden,</hi> and <hi>Harlem;</hi> but <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> for Number, far
exceeds the other two.</p>
            <p>In this laſt Town they make Cloths, Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, and all Sorts of
Woollen and Hair Stuffs; as alſo, all Sorts of Silks, Gold and Silver Stuffs
and Ribbons, and are the beſt made in this Town of any in all the
Provinces.</p>
            <p>Beſides gilt Leather, they work here all other Sorts, as Morocco,
Shammy, and many other Sorts; and it may likewiſe be ſaid, that Dying,
which is ſettled in ſeveral other Towns and Places of theſe Provinces, is
one of the moſt conſiderable Manufactures of this Republick.</p>
            <p>There are alſo at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> ſeveral Houſes for
Refining Sugar, Borax, Camphire, Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and Sulphur; ſeveral for
whitening yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Wax, a great many Saw-Mills for all Sorts of Woods,
Powder-Mills, Snuff-Mills, Mills to poliſh Marble, and Mills to draw Oil from
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56197:24"/>ſeveral Sorts of Seeds. In ſhort, one may ſay of
<hi>Amſterdam</hi> what <hi>Vopiſcus</hi> ſaid of <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
who after he had given an Account of its Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures, added, 
<q rend="inline">"That all its Inhabitants followed ſome Trade;
that the lame and the gouty were employed, and even thoſe that had the Gout
in their Hands did not ſit idle."</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Town of <hi>Leyden,</hi> without Diſpute, is preferable to all
others for all Sorts of Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Manufactures, eſpecially the fineſt Sort;
as Serges, Camlets, and the like. They tell you that theſe Manufactures,
after the Year 1400, began to grow in ſome Eſteem, and the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of
<hi>Ipres</hi> that fled from their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, ſettled themſelves there.
But be that as it will, every Body agrees they had not then that Eſteem, till
after the Perſecutions for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion began, which effectually drove great
Numbers of Workmen from the Provinces of <hi>Flanders, Hainault,</hi> and
<hi>Artois,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>They make alſo good Woollen Stuffs at <hi>Harlem,</hi> but they
are much inferior to thoſe of <hi>Leyden,</hi> which latter may undoubtedly
paſs for the beſt of <hi>Europe</hi> in their Kind.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> have their Wooll from <hi>Spain,</hi> and
<hi>England, Germany, Poland,</hi> and the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi> that Sort of Wooll
called <hi>Vigogue,</hi> from <hi>Peru,</hi> and that of <hi>Coramania</hi>
from <hi>Perſia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The beſt Silks are made at <hi>Harlem,</hi> and this Manufacture,
in its Kind, is not inferior to the Cloth Manuufacture of <hi>Leyden.</hi> They
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56197:24"/>make in this Place, coarſe flowered Velvets, Linnens,
Silks, Gauzes, and in general, all Sorts of ſlight Silks, of which there is a
great Conſumption in <hi>Germany,</hi> and all over the North,
<hi>Portugal,</hi> and other Places, where they prefer theſe Silks, and the
Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Brocades made here to thoſe of <hi>France.</hi> Beſides
they are 15 or 20 <hi>per Cent</hi> cheaper.</p>
            <p>Theſe Manufactures, in Reality, are not ſo beautiful, nor ſo
good as thoſe of <hi>Lyons</hi> and <hi>Tours;</hi> but the Difference in the
Piece makes amends for that, and makes them go off bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And tho' their
Workmen want a Genius for Deſign, and Invention, yet they no ſooner come
from <hi>France,</hi> but they imitate them to Perfection. They know how to
work and finiſh them with all poſſible Dexterity and Neatneſs. This
added to their Cheapneſs, makes other Countries rather make uſe of
them.</p>
            <p>Beſides, the <hi>Dutch</hi> import Silks from <hi>Italy,</hi> the
<hi>Levant, Perſia, Bengal, Tonquin,</hi> and <hi>China.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Town of <hi>Delft</hi> is a Place famous for fine earthen Ware,
in Imitation of <hi>China.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Horne</hi> is for dealing in Cheeſe which is made in the North
of <hi>Holland,</hi> as alſo for large Earthen, or Stone Ware.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Dort</hi> and ſome other Places, there are Houſes for
refining Salt; and if I miſtake not, Places for Spinning and Bleaching
Thread.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sardam,</hi> not far from <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the only Place in the World where all Sorts <pb n="30" facs="tcp:56197:25"/>of Ships are
built for the Uſe of Merchants, not only of the <hi>United Provinces,</hi>
but of other Countries, which cauſes a prodigious Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of Wood,
Cordage, Maſts, Sails, and other Neceſſaries for Shipping, of which great
Numbers are daily ſold to Strangers, ready built, and fit for Launching.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> have their Timber from <hi>Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
Norway,</hi> the Lower <hi>Germany, Pomerania,</hi> and the Provinces bordering
on the <hi>Baltick,</hi> Moſt of this Timber is brought to <hi>Sardam,</hi>
which is a Village ſomewhat more than two Leagues long, whoſe Inhabitants
are all Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters; and they are ſo skilful in their Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that (as
it is credibly reported) if they have three Months Notice before-hand, they can
every Day, for as long a time as is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, build, and compleatly finiſh a
Ship of 4 or 500 Tuns.</p>
            <p>Tho' all the Linnen that goes under the Name of <hi>Holland,</hi> is
not made in the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> yet I cannot but reckon it among
their Manufactures, by reaſon of its being blea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched there. They make vaſt
Quantities in the Provinces of <hi>Groningen, Friſeland,</hi> and
<hi>Ove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſſell,</hi> where there grows Abundance of Flax; and I believe
they make great Quantities in the Dutchy of <hi>Juliers,</hi> which they ſend
thence in the Beginning of the Spring to <hi>Harlem,</hi> where they bleach
wonderfully well by reaſon of the Sea Water, which by its being purified 
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56197:25"/>in the <hi>Downs,</hi> gives the Linnen that beautiful
White which is ſo much admired.</p>
            <p>The Manufactures of Sail Cloth, which was fomerly made in
<hi>Britanny,</hi> Cordage, and Fiſhing Nets, employ almoſt an infinite
Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of People.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> generally bring from <hi>Muſcovy, Poland,
Dantzic, Riga,</hi> and other Towns of the North, thoſe vaſt Quantities of
Hemp and Flax they make uſe of in their Manufactures.</p>
            <p>Printing employs alſo a World of People in theſe Provinces, were
every one ſtrives to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel in that Art. It is the ſame in Hat-making,
which is as conſiderable a Manufacture as that of Paper, which they have
within theſe few Years taken from the <hi>French.</hi> This laſt
Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture of Paper, they have ſet up in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Places; but what they
make in <hi>Guelderland</hi> is much the beſt.</p>
            <p>Navigation and Commerce have ſo near a Relation one to another,
that it is very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult for one to flouriſh in a State without the other;
in Reality, it is impoſſible one ſhould ſubſiſt without the other.
For if Navigation be ſupported by Trade, Trade cannot flouriſh without
Navigation, which may, in ſome Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure be ſaid to be the very Life and
Soul of Trade, ſince by Navigation all Sorts of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe are ſo
eaſily tranſported to all Ports of the World, and with ſo little Expence.
And whatever Nation can make it ſelf Maſter of <pb n="32" facs="tcp:56197:26"/>Navigation, will be ſo of Trade, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently immenſe
Riches, and (if I may uſe the Expreſſion) even of Empires and
Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> who know very well this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Truth, have
for that End omitted no Pains nor Expence; and it has ever been the principal
Object of their Care and Application. It muſt be owned, that their Fiſhery
Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, and vaſt Trade have furniſhed them with all poſſible
Advantages of raiſing their Maritime Affairs above thoſe of other Nations;
And the Secret they have found out of ſailing, and carrying Goods much
cheaper than other People, has contributed as much. This makes other Nations
willing to employ the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships, becauſe 'tis not only leſs
expenſive, but they can have in <hi>Holland</hi> Ships always ready to ſail
for all Countries, but alſo becauſe of the Convoys they ſend with their
Merchant Ships. Beſides, they are very juſt and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in giving a good
Account of all they are entruſted with. This Truſt conſiderably
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes their Navigation, and cauſes them to build a vaſt Number of
Ships, which gives conſtant Employment to a prodigious Number of Seamen, who
repair thither from all Parts, and on their Arrival, are always ſure of
fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Buſineſs. The Maſters of Ships of Freight, in <hi>Holland,</hi>
make up a conſiderable Part of that State.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:56197:26"/>We come now to Diſcourſe of the Trade of the
<hi>United Provinces</hi> to ſeveral Parts of the World; but it will not be
improper firſt to obſerve, that ſuch Foreign Trade is princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
carried on by the Merchants of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of <hi>Holland</hi> and
<hi>Zeland,</hi> &amp;c. and that ſome certain Species of Commerce is
peculiar to ſome certain Towns.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Amſterdam</hi> makes much the greateſt Figure in foreign
Traffick; for beſides the Trade of both the <hi>Indies,</hi> ſhe has
likewiſe that of the <hi>Levant, Cadiz, Lisbon, Muſcovy,</hi> and the
North, which laſt is peculiar to her ſelf; ſome ſmall Trade ſhe has
with <hi>France,</hi> for Wines and Brandy, but nothing in Compariſon to
<hi>Roterdam:</hi> The Situation of this laſt Town on the <hi>Meuſe</hi> or
<hi>Maeſe,</hi> has made her Trade with <hi>France, England</hi> and
<hi>Scotland,</hi> very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable; ſhe drives, beſides, a great Trade
to the <hi>Levant, Spain,</hi> and the <hi>Eaſt-Indies;</hi> in ſhort, this
Town has Commerce with all Parts, the North excepted, yet much inferior to that
of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> tho' her Port ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageouſly ſituated on the
<hi>Maeſe,</hi> as I hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, is infinitly better and much more
commodious.</p>
            <p>The Trade of <hi>Dort</hi> conſiſts in little elſe than that
of Rheniſh-Wine, (which is there put on Shoar,) and white Salt, refin'd in
that Town. The <hi>Dutch</hi> have moſt of their pickled and dry'd Salmon
from <hi>Dort.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:56197:27"/>
               <hi>Delft, Horn,</hi> and <hi>Enchuiſen,</hi>
have each their peculiar Chamber in the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
<hi>Delft</hi> is particularly famous for its fine Earthen-ware, reſembling
that of <hi>China; Horn</hi> for Cheeſe, which its Inhabitants tranſport to
all Parts in great Quantities; and ſome Years ago, this Commodity of
Cheeſe, and ſome other Articles, made Trade conſiderably flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in
<hi>Horn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Commerce of <hi>Enchuiſen</hi> conſiſts chiefly in
Herrings, which makes that Town very conſiderable, and very rich.</p>

            <head>CHAP. IV. Of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Trade in the North,

            </head>
            <p>I Begin with the Northern Trade, not only becauſe 'tis one of the
firſt the <hi>Dutch</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd themſelves to; but alſo, becauſe 'tis
of the greateſt Importance and Neceſſity of any to that Republick;
ſince from hence ſhe has the greateſt Part of her Proviſions; as Wheat
and other Grain, ſo neceſſary for the Subſiſtance of her People; as
alſo, all Things neceſſary for their Navigation, without which, and
o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Commodities of abſolute Neceſſity, they would find it very
difficult to ſupport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. <pb n="35" facs="tcp:56197:27"/>Under this Article of
the Northern Trade, I comprehend that of <hi>Muſcovy, Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> and all
the Ports of the <hi>Baltick</hi>-Sea; that is, that of <hi>Sweden, Denmark,
Poland,</hi> and all the <hi>Lower-Germany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Hanſe Towns for many Years together engroſſed this Trade;
but <hi>Erick</hi> the 8th of that Name, King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> againſt
whom they waged a cruel and bloody War, having about the Year 1403, call'd in
the <hi>Zelanders</hi> and ſome other Nations to his Aſſiſtance, open'd
to them the South-Paſſage for their more commodious carrying on their Trade
to the <hi>Baltick,</hi> thinking he could have no better way to be revenged on
theſe Towns; ſince that time 'tis true they have often boaſted of their
keeping that Sea clear of Foreigners, but to little purpoſe; and their Trade
(the greateſt that ever was then known) declining in the Year 1500,
diminiſhed to that Degree, that their Power came to little or nothing about
the Year 1506.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> applying themſelves very
earneſtly to Navigation, and the former having with much Honour put an end to
a War, they had ſo long maintain'd againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> for
their Liberties, by the Treaty of 1609, all Nations, eſpecially ſuch as
were trading People, courted their Alliance: the Hanſe Towns were the firſt
that diſcover'd their Inclinations, believing that nothing would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute 
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56197:28"/>more to the Preſervation of the little Trade and Credit
they had left.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch,</hi> on their ſide, deſir'd nothing more than
ſuch an Alliance, which promis'd them great Advantage in the Northern Trade;
and accordingly, on the 22d of <hi>May</hi> 1631, ſign'd a Treaty of
Confederacy with <hi>Lubeck,</hi> then Chief of the <hi>Teutonick</hi> Hanſe
Towns, for a free and ſafe Trade to the <hi>Baltick:</hi> In the Year
following, the moſt conſiderable of the other Hanſe Towns follow'd the
Example of <hi>Lubeck;</hi> and the <hi>Dutch</hi> made ſo good uſe of
theſe Treaties, and ſeveral other Advantages they got in the North, that
they have almoſt entirely ſtript all the Hanſe Towns, <hi>Hamburgh</hi>
only excepted, of the little Trade there was left them, and (if we may be
allow'd to ſay ſo) made themſelves Sole Maſters of all the Commerce of
the North.</p>
            <p>I ſhall in a few Words give you an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their Trade to
<hi>Muſcovy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Trade that <hi>Europe</hi> drove with that vaſt Empire, was
carried on conſtantly by the way of <hi>Revel</hi> and <hi>Narva,</hi> two
Towns in <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonia,</hi> ſituated on the extream Parts of the
<hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi> till the Year 1653; but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> who firſt
attempted the North-Paſſage to <hi>China,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
<hi>Archangel,</hi> one of the beſt Ports the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> have upon
the <hi>White Sea,</hi> and the moſt proper and commodious for a great Trade,
being but ſeven or eight Leagues diſtant from <pb n="37" facs="tcp:56197:28"/>the
famous River <hi>Duina,</hi> which runs thro' the greateſt Part of
<hi>Muſcovy;</hi> and the Czar granted them great Privileges, to engage them
to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle a Trade at <hi>Archangel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> ſoon follow'd the ſame Route; and, in ſpite
of all the Obſtacles the <hi>Engliſh</hi> put in their Way, they obtain'd
of the Czar the ſame Permiſſion to Trade to <hi>Archangel,</hi> as the
<hi>Engliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Every Year ſince that Grant, they have ſent thither 36 or 40
Sail of Ships, from 200 to 400 Tuns, which go always from <hi>Holland</hi> in
two Squadrons; the firſt conſiſting only of 5 or 6 Ships, goes off
uſually in the Month of <hi>June,</hi> and returns in <hi>September;</hi> and
the ſecond, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of 30, or 34 Ships, fails in <hi>July,</hi> and
returns not from <hi>Archangel</hi> till the end of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber:</hi> Theſe
two Fleets, which vary ſometimes as to their Number, have always a Convoy
allow'd them by the City of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> which City engroſſes
almoſt all that Trade. The Principal Time of Traffick, is during the Fan of
<hi>Archangel,</hi> which begins the 20th of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt,</hi> and ends the

            <p>I ſhall give you here a ſhort Account of the Principal
Commodities the <hi>Dutch</hi> import to <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> and what they
bring thence, <hi>viz.</hi> Silk, Linnen and Woollen Stuffs, Beaver's Skins
from <hi>Canada,</hi> Paper, Small-Ware of all ſorts, and Iron-work, Cannon,
and Small Arms, Gun-powder, Sulphur, Copper,

               </gap>, <pb n="38" facs="tcp:56197:29"/>Tin,
Wines, Brandies, Oils, and Vinegar, Confections and dry Fruits, Saffron, Sugar,
Spices, Pepper, and Pickled Herrings of the firſt Seaſon, Frankincenſe,
Copperas, Ceruſe, or White-Lead, Indigo, and all ſorts of Woods for dying
Red, Galloons and Laces of all ſorts, Gold and Silver-Thread, and all ſorts
of Silver Coin.</p>
            <p>I ſhall before I conclude this Treatiſe, make ſome Remarks on
the Commodities ſent to and exported from <hi>Muſcovy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However by this Account, one may eaſily ſee, how conſiderable
the <hi>Dutch</hi> Trade to <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy</hi> is, not only in relation to its
Convoys and Returns, but alſo on Account of the Number of Ships it
continually maintains. One would have imagin'd the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who
firſt enjoy'd the Privileges of paying no manner of Cuſtom, ſhould have
made themſelves en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely Maſters of the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Trade;
how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, it is certain, they ſend now a-days no more than 4 or 5 Veſſels
thither, while the <hi>Dutch</hi> commonly ſend 40, or thereabouts.</p>
            <p>A certain <hi>Engliſh</hi> Author has taken a great deal of Pains,
to let us know what Methods the <hi>Dutch</hi> made uſe of to raiſe their
Commerce with <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> above that of <hi>England:</hi> His Words are
theſe:</p>
            <q> 
               <p> The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cloths are not valued in
<hi>Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> becauſe they are dearer than thoſe of
<hi>Holland,</hi> which, tho' they ſhrink after being <pb n="39" facs="tcp:56197:29"/>wet, above a ſixth part, yet the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them
to our Cloths, becauſe ſay they, no Cloth will ſhrink but what is New. It
muſt be own'd, that we are much in the wrong in not complying with their
Humour, and reſtraining our ſelves to that Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty only, while the
<hi>Dutch</hi> bring them thither a vaſt Quantity of Toys, things that ſell
better there than Cloths, which begin now to be out of Faſhion in that
Country.</p> 
               <p> If the <hi>Dutch</hi> have entirely eſtabliſh'd in
<hi>Ruſſia</hi> the <hi>Perſian</hi> and <hi>Indian</hi> Silk Trade, I am
afraid the <hi>Engliſh</hi> will find it a a very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult Matter to
recover their Immunities and Privileges; for the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> are now
grown cunning, having been corrupted by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who know well how
to diſtribute their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to the beſt Advantage, and being much richer in
that Country, and of greater Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and more numerous than the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> leave no Stone unturn'd to ruine them, and have ſucceeded
too well in their Project, much better than could be imagin'd. By Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
they gain the Friendſhip and Protection of the Nobility, and make us
deſpicable by ſcandalous Pictures, and impudent defamato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Libels.</p> 
               <p> The only way in my Opinion, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſh our Reputation and
Commerce in that Country, would be to permit only ſuch Merchants to trade
thither as ſhould <pb n="40" facs="tcp:56197:30"/>give no Credit for any Merchandize,
tho' the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> fix a Time for Payment, and to repreſent by
Perſons of Worth and good Underſtanding, the flouriſhing Condition of the
Dominions of the King of <hi>Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</hi>
               </p> 
            </q>
            <p>Let us now come to the Trade of <hi>Norway.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Riches of this Kingdom, which is in ſubjection to the Crown of
<hi>Denmark,</hi> conſiſt in Maſts for Ships, and other ſorts of
Timber, as well for Ship-building as other Carpenter's Work, Copper, and Iron
Mines, Pitch and Tar, dry'd Fiſh, Furrs, Buck-ſkins, Aſhes, Butter and
Tallow.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Chief Commodities the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> Merchants
exchange with Foreigners for many things they want, of abſolute Neceſſity
for the Support of Life. The <hi>Dutch</hi> who have a greater Trade to
<hi>Norway</hi> than all other Nations put together, carry uſually thither
Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Salt, Canary, Vinegar, Brandy, Cheeſe, Tobacco Rolls, Drapery, and
Small Wares.</p>
            <p>Tho' this Kingdom is of vaſt Extent, yet there is but very little
Conſumption, being nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Rich nor well Peopled; and it may be ſaid, that
even Money would be entirely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known here, was it not for what the
<hi>Dutch</hi> bring along with them to buy Timber.</p>
            <p>But however inconſiderable the <hi>Norway</hi> Trade may ſeem,
it employs notwithſtanding near 300 <hi>Dutch</hi> Veſſels, moſt of
which come <pb n="41" facs="tcp:56197:30"/>from the Towns and Villages of
<hi>Friſeland,</hi> and thoſe about <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> they are commonly
of 4 or 500 Tons Burthen, and have not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 10 or 12 Hands a-piece.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Berghen,</hi> the Capital of <hi>Norway,</hi> has a good Port,
and is the Place of greateſt Trade: The <hi>Dutch</hi> reſort to ſeveral
other Ports, as <hi>Dron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theim</hi> and <hi>Copernick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As Timber is the chief Commodity the <hi>Dutch</hi> deal for in
<hi>Norway,</hi> and which they bring in great Quantities from that Kingdom,
they have concluded many Treaties with the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> to ſecure
that Trade, <hi>viz.</hi> the Treaty of <hi>Chriſtianople,</hi> ſigned
<hi>Auguſt</hi> 13, 1645, and that of the <hi>Hague,</hi> the 12th of
<hi>February</hi> 1669.</p>

            <head>CHAP. V. Of the <hi>Baltick</hi> Trade.</head>
            <p>THE Trade of this Sea, which is almoſt 2000 Leagues in
Circumference, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes that of the Kingdoms of <hi>Sweden</hi> and
<hi>Denmark;</hi> the Countries of <hi>Mecklenberg, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merania, Pruſſia,
Courland</hi> and <hi>Livonia;</hi> moſt of which, ſupply the
<hi>Dutch</hi> with a prodigious Quantity of all ſorts of Grain, abundance of
Copper, Iron, Steel, Arms of all ſorts, Wood <pb n="42" facs="tcp:56197:31"/>and Timber,
Hemp, Flax, Pitch, Tar, and ſeveral other Commodities.</p>
            <p>They carry a much greater Quantity of Goods from the
<hi>Baltick</hi> than they bring to it, the Conſumption being very
inconſiderable in thoſe Parts, unleſs it be at <hi>Dantzick,</hi> which
is the common Magazine or Store-houſe of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> the Diſcount or
Overplus they pay in <hi>Rixdollars,</hi> which they bring along with them.</p>
            <p>As moſt of the Commodities that come from the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea
are bulky and very heavy, that Trade employs a great Number of Ships, and the
<hi>Dutch</hi> ſend thither every Year 1000 or 1200.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Denmark</hi> yields but few Commodities to Strangers, and the
Trade of that Kingdom is nothing near ſo conſiderable as that of
<hi>Norway;</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> bring a pretty good Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Wheat from
the ſinall Iſland of <hi>Laland,</hi> which is very fruitful in all ſorts
of Grain, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially Wheat. About forty Years ago they uſed to lade about
twelve Ships with Rye from the Iſle of <hi>Zeland,</hi> but the Boors now
a-days ſcarce Sow more than what ſuffices for their Subſiſtance.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> bring alſo every Year vaſt Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of lean
Horn'd Cattle from <hi>Jutland,</hi> which they turn into the Meadows in
<hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to fatten; and this is none of the leaſt profitable
Articles in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Trade.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:56197:31"/>
               <hi>Denmark</hi> has no conſiderable Port, but
that of <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> which in reality is one of the fineſt in the
World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sweden</hi> ſupplies the <hi>Dutch</hi> with more Commodities
than <hi>Denmark,</hi> and its Trade is much more conſiderable. The
princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Goods they bring from this Country are Copper, (the beſt in
<hi>Europe</hi>) Iron, Steel, great Quantities of all ſorts of Arms made of
thoſe Mettals, as Muskets, Piſtols, Cannons for Ships, Bullets, Pikes,
Helmets, Breaſt-Plates, and Braſs Wire, not to mention vaſt Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of other Goods and Commodities, as Lead, Copper, Pitch, Tar, Maſts, Planks,
and Barks made of Deal, the beſt in the North.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> on their Part, furniſh <hi>Sweden</hi> with the
ſame Commodities as they do <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> and much about the ſame
Quantity, <hi>viz.</hi> Spices and Drugs of all ſorts, Salt, Sugar, Wines,
Brandies, Linnen, Silks, and Woollen Stuffs, and ſuch other Manufactures as
thoſe two Northern Kingdoms ſtand moſt in need of. The <hi>Dutch</hi> may
be ſaid to be in ſome ſort the Maſters of the greateſt Part of the
<hi>Swediſh</hi> Trade, ſince they are of the Copper. The Farmers of
theſe Mines, having always Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for Money, ſell this Commodity to
the Merchants of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> who advance them whatever Sums they
want: 'Tis juſt the ſame with their Pitch and Tar, the ſame Merchants
buying moſt of theſe Goods from the King's <pb n="44" facs="tcp:56197:32"/>Farmers, and
making them beſides very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Advances: This is the Reaſon why
theſe and other <hi>Swediſh</hi> Goods are ſold as cheap at
<hi>Amſterdam</hi> as in <hi>Sweden</hi> itſelf.</p>
            <p>The chief Trade this Kingdom has with Foreigners, is at
<hi>Stockholm,</hi> the Capital City, and ſome other Ports of the ancient
Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Sweden,</hi> as well as thoſe of its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts in
<hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Poland,</hi> of which I ſhall diſcourſe
hereafter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pomerania</hi> in the Year 1648, was divided by the Treaty of
<hi>Oſnabrugh,</hi> between the <hi>Swedes</hi> and <hi>Brandenburghers;</hi>
that Part of it which is waſhed by the <hi>Oder,</hi> and the Ports of
<hi>Stralſund, Wolgaſt</hi> and <hi>Stetin</hi> belong to the King of
<hi>Sweden,</hi> and the other Part where <hi>Colberg,</hi> a Place of great
Commerce is ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, belongs to the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pomerania</hi> abounds in great Quantities of Corn, vaſt
Numbers of Cattel, Skins, Leather, Wool, Timber, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Iſle of
<hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,</hi> which is one of its Dependencies, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces a great deal of
Wheat.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Stetin,</hi> the Capital of <hi>Pomerania,</hi> ſituated on
the <hi>Oder,</hi> is a Place of the greateſt Trade with Strangers in that
Province; that of <hi>Sileſia</hi> are of the richeſt and moſt fruitful
Provinces in <hi>Germany,</hi> in Corn, Honey, Butter, Wax, Lead, Iron, Wooll,
Tin, Flax, Linnen and Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Cloths, is alſo carried on in <hi>Stetin,</hi>
which likewiſe ſhares great Part of the Trade of the <pb n="45" facs="tcp:56197:32"/>Marquiſate of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> the River <hi>Oder</hi> run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thro' both Provinces.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch,</hi> among other Things, export from
<hi>Pomerania</hi> all ſorts of Corn, vaſt Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of coarſe Wooll,
<hi>Sileſia</hi> Linnen, Timber, Maſts, and other Commodities.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pruſſia</hi> is divided into two Parts, <hi>viz.</hi> the
Royal <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> belonging to the Crown of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the
Ducal <hi>Pruſſia</hi> in ſubjection to the Marquis of
<hi>Brandenburg,</hi> now King of <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> which Title was
conferr'd on him by this Emperor's Father, about 10 or 12 Years ſince. This
Kingdom, or rather Demy-Province, is very fruitful in Wheat, which is look'd
upon to be better than that any in <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> it has ſeveral very good
Sea-Ports, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which <hi>Dantzick, Koningsberg,</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel</hi>
are the moſt conſiderable: The two laſt are in the Ducal, and the firſt
in the Royal <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> and almoſt all the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Trade
is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on in that Port: But before I treat of this Branch of Trade, I
ſhall ſpeak a few Wordsin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to that of the Ducal
<hi>Pruſſia,</hi> part of which is carried on at <hi>Koningsburg,</hi> a
Town ſituated at the Mouth of the <hi>Pregel,</hi> this Port is much
frequented by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as well as <hi>Dutch;</hi> the large
Veſſels commonly unlade at <hi>Pil'aw</hi> (a Port, formerly a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs
only, on the Mouth of the <hi>Friſcknaff</hi>) that they may the more
eaſily go up to <hi>Kon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingsberg;</hi> beſides the Commodities of the 
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56197:33"/>Country, that abound here, <hi>Lithuania</hi> and
<hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> ſend to this Place by the Way of <hi>Pregel,</hi> great
Quantities of Oak for Coopers Work, abundance of Aſhes, Wheat, Leather,
Furrs, Rice, Honey, Wax, Barley, Millet, and Hemp. The <hi>Dutch</hi> bring
likewiſe to <hi>Koningsberg,</hi> Cloths, Wines, Cheeſe, Salt, Tobacco,
Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Iron, Lead, Tin, and old <hi>Dutch</hi> Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Poland</hi> is the moſt fruitful Country in the World, in all
ſorts of Grain, good Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturage, Cattle, Wax, and Honey, beſides Mines of
Salt, Iron, Lead Copper, Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver, Vitriol, Salt-Petre, and Sulphur. All
the Commerce of this great Kingdom is chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carried on at <hi>Dantzick,</hi>
ſome ſmall Part excepted, at the other Ports of <hi>Pruſſia</hi> and
<hi>Livonia:</hi> The Situation of <hi>Dantzick,</hi> on the Mouth of the
<hi>Viſtula,</hi> is wonderfully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious for Trade; for that River, which
is one of the moſt famous in <hi>Europe,</hi> from South to North, runs
thorough the greateſt Part of the fertile Plains of <hi>Poland,</hi> and is
almoſt Navigable all along its Courſe, which is more than 300 Leagues. This
makes <hi>Dant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zick</hi> one of the chief Towns in <hi>Europe,</hi> as well on
Account of its great Trade, as its vaſt Extent, and Riches: The great
Magazines of Wheat in this Place, make it be taken Notice of by all
<hi>Europe;</hi> and for that Reaſon <hi>Dant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zick</hi> is commonly call'd,
the Granary of the <pb n="47" facs="tcp:56197:33"/>Northern Kingdoms, and the <hi>United
Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides <hi>Dantzick,</hi> properly ſpeaking, is a Republic
governed by its own Laws, under the Protection of the Crown of <hi>Poland:</hi>
The Inhabitants have this Privilege, that none but they can buy any
<hi>Poliſh</hi> Corn, if once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd their Port; but then on the other
hand, they muſt take all what is brought at the Price the Magiſtrates
ſhall ſet upon it.</p>
            <p>As the <hi>Poles</hi> are all Strangers to Trade and Navigation, and
much leſs to Manufactures, ſo are they oblig'd to make uſe of Strangers,
the <hi>Dutch</hi> eſpecially, to ſupply them with what Commodities they
from time to time ſtand in need of. Here follows an Account of the Principal
Goods they generally are ſupply'd with from Abroad, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All ſorts of Silks, great Quantities of Cloth, Woods for Dying,
all ſorts of Spices, Drugs, <hi>Italian Crema Tartar,</hi> Sugar, Oyl, Paper;
Wines of all ſorts, <hi>French</hi> Salt and Brandies; of theſe Liquors,
there is a great Conſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in <hi>Pruſſia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Commodities are generally truck'd for Wheat, and other Corn,
Oak and Deal, excellent Maſts, Hemp and Flax, Honey, Wax and Tallow, Steel,
Iron, Copper and Lead; Saltpetre, Salt, Pitch and Tar, yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Amber, Bulls and

               <hi>Dantzick</hi> being the greateſt Place for
Trade in the North, the <hi>Dutch</hi> have ever taken a particular Care to
aſſiſt that Town in the Preſervation of its Liberties againſt the
At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of the Kings of <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> and other
Powers.</p>
            <p>The Dutchy of <hi>Courland</hi> is a particular So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty, under
the Protection of <hi>Poland; Libaw</hi> and <hi>Memel</hi> are its two
Sea-Ports, from whence, beſides Wheat and Wood, a great deal of Linſeed is
tranſported to <hi>Holland,</hi> where they uſe great Quantities in making
of Oil; great Quantities is likewiſe carry'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Flanders</hi> for
Seed, the Linſeed of thoſe Countries being apt to degenerate, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
unfit for Sowing. I have been credibly informed, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> employ
in the Trade of <hi>Courland,</hi> every Year 20 or 25 Ships.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Livonia</hi> belongs to <hi>Sweden;</hi> and is one of the
moſt fruitful Countries in the World for Wheat, and would be one of the
richeſt, had not a long War ſwept off ſuch vaſt Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of its
Inhabitants: Not only the greateſt Commerce of this vaſt Province, but good
Part of that of <hi>Muſcovy</hi> and <hi>Lithuania</hi> is carried on in the
Ports of <hi>Riga, Revel</hi> and <hi>Narva;</hi> it is partly by the River
<hi>Narva,</hi> and partly by their Sledges in the great Snows, that the
<hi>Muſcovites</hi> and <hi>Lithuanians</hi> bring to <hi>Riga</hi> their
Flax, Hemp, Wax, Pitch, Wheat and Furrs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <hi>Revel</hi> has for a long time ſince, been

reaſon of thoſe great Quantities of excellent and well proportion'd
Maſts, and other fit Timber that come thither by Water: It is believ'd, if

            <p>AS there are much more Goods that come from the North, than what are

diſcharge the overplus; and it would be difficult, without this neceſſary

theſe Northern People get, merely on Account of their Trade, Money would be
very ſcarce with them, as I obſerved before.</p>
            <p>Next to Gold and Silver, Spices are the beſt Commodities one can
carry into the North; theſe are as much valued there; as if they 
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56197:35"/>were things abſolutely neceſſary to ſupport Life;
there is a prodigious Conſumption of them, eſpecially in <hi>Muſcovy</hi>
and <hi>Poland.</hi> The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in <hi>Muſcovy</hi> is chiefly in
Nutmegs and Pepper, which they uſe in their ordinary Drink, as well as in
Brandy; and I have been very well aſſured, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> have
brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> 8 or 900 Bails of Pepper and Nutmegs. Sugar,
Tobacco, and Drugs, both for the Apothecary and Dying, ſell well in the
North; Sea-Salt is alſo a very neceſſary Commodity in the North, of which
there is almoſt an infinite Conſumption: They have many Years ſince laid
aſide the making of Salt themſelves, having been uſed to the
<hi>Portugal</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Salt. And as for the <hi>French</hi>
Salt, there is ſcarce any ſold but in <hi>Pruſſia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is likewiſe in theſe Countries a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Conſumption
of <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wines, Brandy, Oil and Vinegar; Paper
and dry'd Fruits of all ſorts; in ſhort, whatever the warm Countries
produce ſell well here. In <hi>Muſcovy</hi> and <hi>Poland</hi> there is
alſo a vaſt Conſumption of Cloth and Woollen Stuffs, and Silks of the
<hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Manufactury; but theſe Stuffs, Silks,
and Cloth, muſt be of all Sorts, Qualities, and Colours; they ſell great
Quantities of the coarſer ſort in <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy,</hi> as well as coarſe
Linnen, in the other Countries of the North; the vent of Woollen-Stuffs is not
ſo conſiderable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:56197:36"/>Almoſt all the Silks, Gold and Silver
Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cades, they bring into the North, are made in <hi>Holland;</hi> heretofore
they uſed to have them from <hi>France,</hi> as well as other Commodities
neceſſary for the Northern Countries; that is, Wines and Brandy, Syrups,
Apples, Cheſnuts, Soap, Paper, Hats, Brocades, Ribands, Iron-Ware and Small
Wares from <hi>Paris;</hi> Stuffs made at <hi>Rheims</hi> and <hi>Chalons;</hi>
but the Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe Commodities of the <hi>French,</hi> was very
much diminiſhed even before the laſt War, the <hi>Dutch,</hi> their near
Neighbours and Enemies, having ſet up in <hi>Holland</hi> moſt of their
Manufactures; who by reaſon of the War between the two Nations, reſolv'd to
ſeek elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where thoſe neceſſary Proviſions they ſtood ſo much
in need of at Home, and that they might continue and augment their Northern
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, entirely abandoned that of <hi>France,</hi> which indeed, by
reaſon of almoſt continual Wars, was very nigh reduced to nothing.</p>
            <p>All the Commodities exported to the North, moſt of which being
neceſſary for Proviſions and Cloathing, are paid for with the
Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of the Country. Corn ought to be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned the chief Article
amongſt the Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the North, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> deal in; and
that Trade is one of the moſt neeceſſary and conſiderable they can have
in the <hi>Baltick;</hi> for they not only bring thence ſufficient for their
own Subſiſtance, but ſend vaſt Quantities into <pb n="53" facs="tcp:56197:36"/>
               <hi>France</hi> at a prodigious Price, as well as into <hi>Italy,
Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> nay even into <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> it ſelf,
in a ſcarce Year.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> employ commonly in this Trade only, 7 or 800
Ships, that go for Wheat and other Grain to the Ports of the
<hi>Baltick</hi>-Sea, <hi>Hamburg</hi> and <hi>Dantzick</hi> it ſelf, and
ſometimes as far as <hi>Muſcovy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſeveral ſorts of Grain they chiefly bring thence into
<hi>Holland,</hi> are, <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Wheat, or Buck-Wheat, Linſeed,
Rice, Millet, and Hemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed; <hi>Dantzick</hi> is the principal Port whence
they chiefly have theſe ſorts of Grain and Seed; they export great
Quantities likewiſe from the Ports of <hi>Livonia, Pruſſia, Pomera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,
Holſtein, Denmark</hi> and <hi>Sweden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next to this the moſt conſiderable is the Wood or Timber Trade;
for not only their Shipping conſume vaſt Quantities, but they uſe
beſides no leſs in making Tuns, Pipes, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, and other Cask; not
including what is uſed in Houſes, Buildings, ſmall Boats, Dikes, Piles,
and Fortifications, both by Sea and Land. They ſell alſo not a little to
the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> at very high Rates; but all this is
nothing to that prodigious Quantity they uſe in building Ships and other
Veſſels, which are continually employ'd either for their own Uſe or other
Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Fir or Deal they have chiefly from <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> and
<hi>Sweden.</hi> The <hi>Baltick</hi> likewiſe ſupplies them with fine Oaks
and Oak-Planks for Coopers <pb n="54" facs="tcp:56197:37"/>Work. Ship-Maſts, as I
obſerved before, come from <hi>Norway, Muſcovy, Riga, Nerva, Revel</hi> and
<hi>Dantzick.</hi> The <hi>Dutch</hi> bring beſides great Quantities of
Timber into <hi>Holland,</hi> by the Rivers <hi>Rhine, Elbe,</hi> and
<hi>Weſer;</hi> ſo that this may be reckon'd as one of the moſt important
and neceſſary Trades to their Republick. To be convinced of this, one need
only ſee their Magazine at <hi>Sardam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hemp and Flax make one of the moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous Articles of the
Trade of the North: 'Tis very eaſy to judge, that the Quantity that comes
thence muſt be prodigious, being ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to furniſh almoſt all the
Ports of <hi>Europe.</hi> This Commodity of Hemp comes from <hi>Riga,
Konigsberg, Nerva, Revel</hi> and <hi>Muſcovy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> deal alſo in vaſt Quantities of Wooll, which
they tranſport from all Parts of the North, as well from <hi>Poland,
Pruſſia,</hi> and <hi>Pomerania,</hi> as from <hi>Denmark, Holſtein,
Mecklenberg, Sileſia, Saxony, Brandenburg,</hi> and the other Countries of
the <hi>Lower-Germany;</hi> as likewiſe, in a great deal of Linnen from
<hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſia,</hi> which is particularly employ'd in the Trade to
<hi>Spain</hi> and the Coaſt of <hi>Africa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They make very rich Returns in Sables and other Furs from
<hi>Muſcovy;</hi> thence come like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Skins ready dreſt, or Leather, as
well as from <hi>Poland, Pruſſia</hi> and <hi>Denmark:</hi> That which we
call <hi>Ruſſia</hi>-Leather, which is made of the Hides of Cows and Oxen,
is dreſt by <pb n="55" facs="tcp:56197:37"/>the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> in ſuch a Manner,
as no where elſe to be imitated. This Trade is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, and they
vend great Quantities of theſe Commodities in <hi>France, Spain</hi> and
<hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Muſcovy</hi> comes alſo the fine Bever-Fur, to make
Hats; this Fur is for the moſt part very ſoft and ſilky; and the
<hi>Muſcovites</hi> have it in great Quantities brought to them in whole
Skins from <hi>Canada,</hi> and is the fineſt in the World; they have an Art
to Dreſs them ſo advantageouſly, as to make the Fur very long and thick,
and with theſe Skins they bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and line their Cloaths.</p>
            <p>The Caviear that is brought from <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> and is made of
the Spawn of Sturgeons, is a good Commodity in <hi>Italy:</hi> They pretend
that there goes out every Year from <hi>Arch-Angel,</hi> bound directly for
<hi>Leghorn</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> at leaſt 3 or 4 Ships, which are above
one fourth Part laden with Caviear; the reſt of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is of
<hi>Ruſſia</hi> Leather.</p>
            <p>The Wax-Trade is very advantageous to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and which
they likewiſe carry on in the North, this Commodity being ſubject neither
to ſpoil or waſte; and this they ſell and trade with in the greateſt
and beſt Parts of <hi>Europe</hi> for immenſe Sums; and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
in <hi>America</hi> is no leſs. Therefore this Commodity ought to be
conſidered as one of the greateſt Articles of Trade between
<hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> 
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:56197:38"/>and <hi>Spain:</hi> The Yellow Wax, which
comes from the North, is chiefly the produce of <hi>Poland</hi> and
<hi>Muſcovy,</hi> Countries where the Bees ſeem to have choſen
principally to reſide.</p>
            <p>Yellow or Fat Amber is no where found, or fiſhed for, but in the
Banks of the Ducal <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> (now the Kingdom of that Name:) I have
been aſſured from good Hands, that the Farming only of that Fiſhery,
brought yearly into the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg</hi>'s Coffers no leſs
than ſeventy five Thouſand Livres. The Brown Amber is the Product alſo of
that new Kingdom, and ſerves to Trade with even to <hi>Guinea</hi> and the
<hi>Eaſt-Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Aſhes are a great Article in the Northern Trade, and chiefly come
from <hi>Dantzick, Ko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigsberg</hi> and <hi>Muſcovy;</hi> but the laſt are
eſteemed the beſt: They deal for vaſt Quantities, to make black Soap and
ſcower Cloth.</p>
            <p>Pitch and Tar being Things abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for
Navigation, to caulk and otherwiſe fortify Ships, Boats and other
Veſſels, there is a vaſt Conſumption of theſe in <hi>Holland.</hi>
They have the greateſt Quantities from <hi>Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holm</hi> and
<hi>Wirtzburg,</hi> but what comes from <hi>Muſcovy</hi> is the
deareſt.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> export a great deal of Tallow from
<hi>Muſcovy,</hi> tho' it be not ſo good as their own; they I kewiſe are
furniſhed with it from <hi>Germany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:56197:38"/>Iron comes chiefly from <hi>Sweden,</hi> and
Steel from <hi>Dantzick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Copper from <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Norway;</hi> but that from
<hi>Sweden</hi> is beſt, and in greater Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties than elſewhere.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> are ſupplied from the North, and eſpecially
<hi>Sweden,</hi> with ſeveral ſorts of Arms and warlike Stores; and that in
ſuch large Quantities, as not only to furniſh them ſufficiently for their
own Fleets and Armies, but to bring them in beſides prodigious Sums of Money,
by trading with theſe Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to almoſt all other Nations. I take no
notice of a great many other Particulars of the Northern Trade, being Matters
of leſs Moment, but paſs them over in ſilence, as I have other things of
the like Nature, in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Trade of other Countries.</p>
            <p>It is eaſie to ſee by the Variety and great Quantity of
Merchandize, that the Trade of the North muſt needs be of extream Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> ſince it ſupplies them with almoſt every thing
that is neceſſary for their Subſiſtence and Navigation; this makes them
omit nothing to preſerve it: They have ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly oppos'd the Northern
Powers, when ever they have endeavour'd to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Maſters of it
(as <hi>Sweden</hi> amongſt the reſt has often attempted to do) and then
they have ever taken Care, by all means, to hinder too great Impoſts or
Cuſtoms to be laid on ſuch <pb n="58" facs="tcp:56197:39"/>Merchandize as come from
thence, or are tranſported thither; and to compaſs this, they have more
than once engaged in long and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Wars.</p>
            <p>The Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> well knew that the only way to
ſap the very Foundation of the Republick of <hi>Holland,</hi> would be to
deprive her of the Trade of the <hi>Baltick,</hi> which made
<hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> II. endeavour with all his Power, to make himſelf Lord of
that Sea. That Houſe has ſince made frequent Attempts to trouble their
Commerce, but with very little Succeſs.</p>
            <p>I deſign one time or other, more fully to ſet forth what the
<hi>Dutch</hi> have done in relation to their Trade, either by private
Negociations or open Force: But in the mean while I ſhall ſay this in
ſhort, that one of the Fundamental Maxims of their Government, is, by all
means poſſible to hinder the Merchants of the North to Trade in too great
Numbers to the Southern and Weſtern Parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> and theſe on
the other hand, from trading in too great Numbers to the North.</p>
            <p>This Republick being ſo advantagiouſly ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated in the middle
of both, will always with her utmoſt Power endeavour that the Trade of
<hi>Europe</hi> ſhould not be carried on but through her hands, by which
means ſhe will always have that good Fortune of knowing the Secret, how to
ſell all ſorts of Merchandize cheaper than any other Country, 
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56197:39"/>and almoſt as cheap as where they were firſt made and
produc'd.</p>

by way of theſe Rivers; the three laſt of which diſembogue themſelves

            <p>The <hi>Elbe</hi> takes its Source in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and after

            <head>CHAP. VII. Of the Trade of the <hi>Spaniſh
Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THIS Country heretofore, the Seat or Centre of a prodigious Trade,
has now very little, by the great Application and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of the
<hi>Dutch,</hi> and particularly the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> to hinder
even its recovery again in <hi>Flanders,</hi> eſpecially at <hi>Antwerp.</hi>
In the Truce made in the Year 1609, the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> would have oblig'd
them to take off the Impoſts they laid on the Navigation of the
<hi>Scheld</hi> and other Rivers during the War, which gave a great Blow to the
Trade of the <hi>Low Countries;</hi> but the States General would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
conſent to it, in hopes entirely to ruine the <pb n="65" facs="tcp:56197:42"/>Commerce of
the <hi>Low Countries</hi> ſubject to the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> and draw
it to themſelves.</p>
            <p>When they made Peace with <hi>Spain,</hi> at the Treaty of
<hi>Munſter,</hi> they took all imaginable Precautions leaſt Commerce
ſhould be re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd at <hi>Antwerp</hi> thro' a long Peace; not
doubting but the advantagious Situation of that City for Trade, would once
again revive it, if not timely obſtructed: They ſtipulated then that they
ſhould keep the <hi>Scheld</hi> block'd up, that all Merchandize that went up
that River ſhould pay certain Cuſtoms at the Fort of <hi>Ryſſel,</hi>
and that Ships and large Veſſels ſhould paſs no further, but unlade
their Goods into Boats and ſmall Barks, to carry them to
<hi>Antwerp.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They had no Apprehenſion that Trade ſhould ever flouriſh again
at <hi>Bruges</hi> or <hi>Ghent,</hi> ſince they were Maſters of the Canals
of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of <hi>Sluice</hi> and <hi>Sas Van Ghent,</hi> to the very
Sea.</p>
            <p>I am very well ſatisfy'd the <hi>Dutch</hi> would never have
conſented to a Peace with <hi>Spain,</hi> how advantagious ſoever it might
be, had they not ſeen it in their Power to hinder the re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment
of Commerce in <hi>Flanders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Trade the <hi>Dutch</hi> drive in <hi>Flanders</hi> and
<hi>Brabant,</hi> (both in Obedience to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi>) is
principally eſtabliſh'd at <hi>Antwerp, Ghent, Bruges,</hi> and
<hi>Mehclin:</hi> The chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities they deal for in theſe Provinces,
eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially <pb n="66" facs="tcp:56197:43"/>in the Towns of <hi>Antwerp,
Bruſſels,</hi> and <hi>Mechlin,</hi> are Thread, and Lace, which they make
with that admirable Beauty and large Quantities, as is almoſt incredible.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Ghent</hi> and <hi>Bruges</hi> they fetch a vaſt Quantity
of fine Linnen of all ſorts, as well for the Table, as other uſes: The
firſt of theſe is famous for Serges, the other for Sheeps Leather;
<hi>Bruſſels</hi> and <hi>Audenarde</hi> for Tape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, where a long
while ſince began thoſe excellent Manufactures that gave Birth to thoſe
of the Gobelins in <hi>Paris,</hi> which for many Years paſt has been, and
now is, the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Work-houſe in the World.</p>
            <p>To theſe Towns they ſend their own Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures of Stuffs made
of Silk and Wool, Spices, Drugs, Coffee, Tea, Chocolate, and a great Quantity
of Muſlins, and <hi>Indian</hi> Stuffs of all ſorts.</p>
            <p>To this one may add, the Trade they have with <hi>Liſle,
Tournay</hi> and <hi>Mons,</hi> of which they have made themſelves Maſters
by the Force of their Arms, and thoſe of the High Allies; the Trade of
<hi>Liſle</hi> conſiſts chiefly in a ſort of Linnen called there
<hi>Toiles Baptiſtes,</hi> and <hi>Bara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,</hi> or coarſe Camblets.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch,</hi> in ſhort, are Maſters of all the Trade of
the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> and that with all the Liberty, Authority, and
Eaſe imaginable, by reaſon of their bordering on thoſe Provinces, and the
Advantage they have <pb n="67" facs="tcp:56197:43"/>of the Rivers and Canals that run by,
and thro' all the Principal Towns, and wonderfully fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate the Carriage of
all ſorts of Goods from one to another, with great Expedition and very little
Expence.</p>

            <head>CHAP. VIII. Of the Trade with <hi>England.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE Neighbourhood of theſe two Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons has for many Years ſince
eſtabliſh'd a mutual Commerce between them; but it has ſometimes been
interrupted: In the Uſurpation of <hi>Cromwel,</hi> the Parliament made a Law
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting ever Nation to bring into <hi>England</hi> any Goods or
Merchandizes but what were of their own Growth and Manufactury.</p>
            <p>This Prohibition was principally levelled at the <hi>Dutch,</hi>
whoſe Country produc'd very little that <hi>England</hi> had Occaſion for,
and had not then any thing like the Manufactures they have at this Day. But at
that time, it was thought prudent not to let thoſe People grow too great, or
rival <hi>England</hi> in Trade. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> I believe,
were not over ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in relation to the Importation of Spices from
<hi>Holland,</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> being Maſters of <pb n="68" facs="tcp:56197:44"/>them, and which could not be had but thro' their means. The
<hi>Dutch</hi> on the contrary, permitted the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to bring into
their Ports all ſort of Goods, whether they were of the Growth of
<hi>England,</hi> or not.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> bring into <hi>Holland</hi> their Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
Cloths of their own Manufactury, and other Stuffs, both of Wool and Silk, Tin,
Lead, Vitriol, Pitcoal, <hi>Virginia</hi> Tobacco, <hi>Barbadoes</hi> Sugar,
and other Sugars of <hi>America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Woollen Manufactures that come from <hi>England</hi> into
<hi>Holland,</hi> are the chief Article of that Trade, their Stuffs ſell
readily; Strangers, and particularly the <hi>Germans,</hi> come to buy them: At
firſt, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> kept their Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Houſe for Cloth at
<hi>Middlebourg</hi> in <hi>Zealand,</hi> then at <hi>Delſt,</hi> after that
at <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> and now at <hi>Dort,</hi> the Magiſtrates having
granted them Privileges for that very Purpoſe: There are certain Days when
they open their Stores to every body, but they generally open them when they
have receiv'd a conſiderable Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Cloth, and they give Notice ſome
time before by Circular Letters.</p>
            <p>Lead and Tin which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> carry to <hi>Holland,</hi>
next to their Cloth and Stuffs, make the moſt conſiderable Article.</p>
            <p>The Tade of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> is
carried on by the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> the Paſſage from <hi>England</hi> being

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Scotch</hi> ſince the Year 1612, have ſet up a

<hi>Engliſh</hi> Way; they bring thither great Quantities of Coal, but not
near ſo good as the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> ſeveral Woollen Stuffs of their own
Manufactury, and particularly Worſted Stockings; and if I am not miſtaken a
great deal of Ox and Cow Hides Calves and Sheeps Leather, Dogs and Rabbits
Skins, as alſo Lead and Tallow.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Iriſh</hi> have no Store-Houſes in all

            <p>The abſolute Neceſſity that the <hi>Dutch</hi> have of the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Ports on the Channel, is one of the principal Reaſons that

            </head>
            <p>THE Trade the <hi>Dutch</hi> have with <hi>France</hi> ſince the
Eſtabliſhment of their Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. has been very conſiderable in
reſpect of the Number, Quantity and Quality of the Merchandize they bring
thither, and carry thence every Year. That which <hi>France</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes
them with, are equally neceſſary to them for their own Subſiſtence, and
their keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up their Trade with other Nations.</p>
            <p>The Principal Things they have from <hi>France,</hi> are Corn of all
kinds, when the Years are good, Wines of all ſorts, particularly thoſe of
<hi>Grave, Champagne</hi> and <hi>Burgundy,</hi> Honey, Saffron, large and
ſmall Cheſnuts, Hazel Nuts, Turpentine, Rozin, Crayons, Verdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greaſe,
Soap, Wax, Cork, Carduus; to theſe may be added, Silks, Taffaties, Gold and
Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Tiſſues, Stuffs of Amiens, Chalons and Rheims, Paper, Parchment,
Hats, Small Wares, and Iron Ware, both ſmall and great, and a world of other
Goods which are (as they call them) the Merchandize of <hi>Paris,</hi> as
Belts, Girdles, Combs, Looking-glaſſes, Trin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, Toys, Gloves, and
Head-dreſſes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:56197:45"/>All theſe different ſorts of Commodities are
ſent by the <hi>Dutch</hi> into all the Provinces of the <hi>North,
Germany,</hi> the <hi>Low Countries, Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal, Italy,</hi>
the <hi>Levant,</hi> the Coaſts of <hi>Africa,</hi> and even the
<hi>Indies.</hi> In ſhort to all the Climates of the World, where theſe
famous Merchants have carried and extended their Traffick.</p>
            <p>They furniſh the <hi>French</hi> in Return with all ſorts of
Spices, Cloth, Drugs, as well for Medicines as Painting; all ſorts of Woods
for Dying; all ſorts of Linnen Cloth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They bring from the
North, Copper, Steel, Braſs Wire, tin'd Plates, or white Iron, Cannons,
Muskets, and other Arms, Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder, Sulphur, Matches, <hi>Ruſſia</hi>
Leather, Furrs, Flax, Hemp, Pitch and Tar, Maſts, Planks, and other Timber
for building Ships or Houſes; to theſe may be added Herrings, and other
Salt Fiſh, Butter, Cheeſe, Tallow, and a great Quantity of other
Merchandize, to ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cify which, would be very difficult and tedious.</p>
            <p>The Advantage and Benefit <hi>France</hi> has found by that Trade,
and the Reaſons of State which united her to his Republick a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the
Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> have made her favour ſuch Commerce in
ſeveral Treaties with the States, and granted them many Privileges; this
together with the Neighbourhood of the two Nations, made the <hi>French</hi>
Trade very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy to the <hi>Dutch;</hi> beſides, the <hi>French</hi> being 
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:56197:46"/>unskill'd in the Art of Navigation, the <hi>Dutch</hi> only
were employ'd in making trading Voya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to all Parts, this filled the
<hi>French</hi> Ports continually with <hi>Dutch</hi> Veſſels, which ever
were taking off their Superfluities, and the Vent of their Commodities,
eſpecially Stuffs and other home Manufactures was very great, and encreaſed
in proportion as the <hi>Dutch</hi> had Liberty to come into their Ports and
Harbous; this made the <hi>French</hi> Trade flouriſh very much, and gave a
Value to their Manufactures.</p>
            <p>The good underſtanding between the two Nations began to
leſſen, when the Treaty of <hi>Munſter</hi> was on Foot, and as the
<hi>French</hi> at that time thought they had reaſon to be diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> they refuſed to renew the ancient Treaties of
Commerce.</p>
            <p>They let their Pirates diſturb their Medite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranian Trade, which
made People believe a War would have enſued at that time between the two
Nations; and the <hi>French</hi> made them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they would prohibit all
<hi>Dutch</hi> Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, at leaſt lay new Duties on what ſhould come
into their Ports. Monſieur <hi>Boreel,</hi> who was then their Ambaſſador
in <hi>France,</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented boldly to that Court, that other People
would be oblig'd in like manner, to lay new Duties on all <hi>French</hi>
Goods, which would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly very much diminiſh their Conſumption, and
conſequently be of Prejudice to that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. The <hi>French</hi> pretended
to be ignorant <pb n="73" facs="tcp:56197:46"/>(or perhaps were really ſo) of the vaſt
Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of their Merchandize that went out of their Country to Foreign
Parts, and told him roundly that the thing was not ſo conſiderable as e
repreſented it to them, and that it was only the Intereſt of his Country
made him talk after that manner.</p>
            <p>To undeceive them, that Gentleman made it appear to the Court that
their Republick ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended every Year above thirty five Millions of
<hi>Livres</hi> in <hi>French</hi> Commodies.</p>

any manner of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Treaty of 1662. They had for ſome Years, it
ſeems, entertain'd a Notion that they could carry on a Trade after a new
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of Method, They pretended to ſell their Goods to their Neighbours,
and buy none of theirs.</p>
            <p>It muſt be allow'd, a finer Project never could be invented to
fill <hi>France</hi> with Gold and Silver; I call it a fine, not pernicious
Project, but it has been found by unhappy Experience, it was altogether
impracticable.</p>
            <p>To put this Project in Execution, the firſt thing they did was to
ſet up an <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Company, as alſo others for the
<hi>Levant</hi> and <pb n="76" facs="tcp:56197:48"/>Northern Trade, in order to furniſh
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with ſuch Merchandize of thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries as they ſhould
have Occaſion of, and in Return, with what might be neceſſary for their
Uſe without having recourſe to Strangers.</p>
            <p>To quit themſelves entirely of Foreign Aſſiſtance, they
began to ſet up in <hi>France</hi> the Manufacturies of other Countries,
imagining at the ſame time, thoſe other Countries could not be without
<hi>French</hi> Goods and Proviſions, and that they would take off the ſame
Quantities as uſual, and by conſequence would be oblig'd to pay ready Money
when they ſaw the <hi>French</hi> take no more of theirs in Return: 'Twas on
this View that in the Year 1667 the <hi>French</hi> laid new Duties on Foreign
Goods eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially Manufactures, which conſequently made them much dearer
than their own, and was done, with intent to make the People pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer their own
to Foreign Manufactures.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> ſeeing themſelves attackt in the moſt
ſenſible Part, ſo well travers'd this new Eſtabliſhment of the
<hi>French</hi> Companies, that at laſt they fell of themſelves. They
forgot nothing that might ruine the Manufactures of <hi>France,</hi> they ſet
up for making themſelves thoſe very Goods they uſed to have from
<hi>France,</hi> and ſold them much cheaper than the <hi>Franch</hi> could
do; Reaſons of State joined to thoſe of Trade, and the Enmity of both 
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56197:48"/>Parties to each other, broke out at laſt into an open
War, which was properly ſpeaking a Trade War. The Conduct of the
<hi>Dutch</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Treaty of <hi>Aix la Chapelle,</hi> the Triple
Alliance made afterwards with <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Sweden</hi> for the
Preſervation of the reſt of the <hi>Spaniſh Low Countries,</hi> and their
Gaſconading Language made the King reſolve they ſhould feel his
Reſentment. To humble this Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, it was thought nothing would go ſo
far as the ruining their Trade, by laying ſtill new Duties on ſuch
Merchandize as ſhould be brought into <hi>France,</hi> or elſe entirely to
prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit it.</p>
            <p>The States-General try'd all ways to engage the <hi>French</hi> to
regulate their Duties upon En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries by the Tariff made in the Year 1664. and to
execute the Treaty of Commerce of the Year 1662; but finding they could do
nothing, they began to fight the <hi>French</hi> with their own Weapons; that
is, they prohibited all <hi>French</hi> Wines and Brandies entring their Ports,
and laid new Duties upon all Goods of the <hi>French</hi> Manufactury; and the
Proviſions and other Merchandize that a long time before they us'd
continually to have from <hi>France,</hi> they then bought and dealt for from
other Parts; the <hi>French</hi> ſoon perceived a very great Diminution of
their Commerce: The War coming on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi>
in the Year 1672, Trade on both ſides was entirely prohibited. 
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:56197:49"/>However, Monſieur <hi>Colbert</hi> happily foreſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that 'twould be a very difficult Matter for <hi>France</hi> to continue long a
War (wherein pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably all <hi>Europe</hi> might be engag'd againſt her) if
no Body took off her Goods and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes, gave Paſſports to every one
that would come and trade thither; and to this wiſe and ſage Conduct, may
be juſtly attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted good part of the happy Succeſs which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
attended that Kingdom.</p>
            <p>That War ending by the Treaty of <hi>Nime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen,</hi> which was
concluded the 10th of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt</hi> 1678. the very ſame Day a new Treaty
of Commerce was ſtruck up, in which it was agreed, that the <hi>French</hi>
and <hi>Dutch</hi> ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy reciprocally the ſame Liberty, in
reſpect of Commerce and Navigation, in each other's Dominions, as they did
before the beginning of that War. In Conſequence of this Treaty, the Tariff
of 1667 was entirely aboliſh'd in favour of the <hi>Dutch;</hi> and that of
1664 was ſet up in its ſtead, generally for all ſorts of Goods
whatſoever, that they ſhould bring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Kingdom, or export thence.
One would have thought that this would have eſtabliſh'd a laſting
Commerce between the two Nations. However, in the beginning of the Year 1680,
the <hi>French</hi> Proviſions and other Goods, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Silks, bore no
Price at <hi>Amſterdam;</hi> and thoſe that traded thither were very
ſenſible, that oftentimes they rather loſt than gain'd, 
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:56197:49"/>as I have elſewhere obſerv'd: So true is it, that
Commerce once deſtroy'd, never again recovers it ſelf. Thoſe Gentlemen
who had the Mangement of Affairs after the Death of Monſieur
<hi>Colbert,</hi> without having any manner of regard to this laſt Treaty,
ſet up the Tariff of 1667, and conſiderably augmented the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in hopes
to augment the Sale of their own Manufactures. The <hi>Dutch</hi> ſeeing
their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce continually attack'd in ſuch open man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and that they had
no hopes of re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing Matters on the ancient Footing, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
themſelves more than ever, with all Care and Diligence, to put themſelves
in that Condition, as never more to have occaſion of the <hi>French</hi>
Manufactures; and they ſucceeded ſo well in this laſt Article, that they
ſet up amongſt themſelves thoſe very Manufacturies; as, the making
Silks, Gold and Silver Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cades, Hats, Paper, Ribands, and Laces,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the <hi>French,</hi> ſince that time, have found to
their no ſmall Detriment, a prodigious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of their Trade in theſe
ſeveral Articles. I believe it may very truly be ſaid, that theſe
Trade-Quarrels were partly the Cauſe of the Wars breaking out again, between
<hi>France</hi> and the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> in the Year 1690. The
Declaration of this War was followed by the moſt ſevere and longeſt
Prohibition of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce that ever was known, and has hitherto continu'd; and
'tis to be fear'd, will only <pb n="80" facs="tcp:56197:50"/>make the <hi>Dutch</hi> know,
they can very eaſily let the <hi>French</hi> Proviſions alone. Time will
make it appear, whether after the Peace, the <hi>Dutch</hi> will reſort to
the Ports of <hi>France</hi> with ſuch Numbers of Merchants-Ships as before;
and we ſhall ſee whether they will take off ſuch vaſt Quantities of
Proviſions, and Goods of the <hi>French</hi> Manufacture, as in times paſt;
'tis much to be wiſh'd they would, as well for the Benefit of Commerce, as
the Good of the State.</p>

            <head>CHAP. X. Of the Trade with <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>NOtwithſtanding the Revolt of the <hi>Dutch</hi> from <hi>Spain,
Philip</hi> the Second pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he knew nothing of their Trading in his
Dominions, under the Colours of his Allies; and tho' he ſaw very well, that
ſuch Trading muſt inevitably furniſh them wherewith to maintain their
Revolt, yet he did not think it worth his while to deprive them of it. It was
the general Opinion, that that Prince acted after that manner, becauſe he had
occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for the Merchandize of the North to equip his Fleets, and which he
could have no other way but by means of the <hi>Dutch:</hi> 
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:56197:50"/>it was believ'd he was likewiſe afraid, that if he ſhould ſhut
them out of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ports, they would, being very powerful at
Sea, open themſelves a Way into the New World. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, notwithſtanding
this Connivance of that Monarch, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in time treated the
<hi>Dutch</hi> Merchants, that traded to <hi>Spain,</hi> with ſuch Cruelty,
and laid on them ſuch heavy Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that they were fore'd to leave off
trading thither, as well as to <hi>Portugal,</hi> which then was ſubject to
<hi>Philip.</hi> The Merchants and Seamen that were employ'd in that Trade,
after it thus expired, took a Reſolution to look out for thoſe Goods in
<hi>Aſia, Africa,</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> which they uſed to have from
<hi>Seville</hi> and <hi>Lisbon;</hi> and this was one of the principal
Cauſes of the Riſe of that Republick, and the Decay of the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philip</hi> the Third, having ſucceeded his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>Philip</hi> the Second, in the Month of <hi>September,</hi> 1598. ſeeing
plainly that all En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours that were uſed to bring the <hi>Dutch</hi> to a
Peace, proved ineffectual, reſolved to forbid them all manner of Trade
whatſoever with his Subjects, hoping that by taking away that which
ſupported them to that time in their War, they would have no mind to continue
it, when they ſhould ſee themſelves depriv'd of ſuch Support. It was
viſible, that all the Riches of <hi>Holland</hi> were the Effects of their
Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Trade, and that their greateſt Traffick <pb n="82" facs="tcp:56197:51"/>was with <hi>Spain,</hi> whither they not only carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the
Merchandize of their own State, but Corn from <hi>Poland</hi> and other
Northern Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, that they might in Exchange carry home vaſt Quantities
of Gold and Silver.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philip</hi> the Third executed his Edict with a great deal of
Severity; a very exact Search was made all over <hi>Spain</hi> for
<hi>Dutch</hi> Merchants and Sailors; ſom of which were condemn'd to
perpetual Impriſonment and the Gallies; others were cruelly put to Death by
ſeveral kinds of Tortures. This Interdiction of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce was likewiſe
puliſhed in the <hi>Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi> in the Name of the Princeſs
<hi>Iſabella,</hi> who was at that time their Sovereign.</p>
            <p>The States General, on the other hand, were not contented with
barely prohibiting all Commerce with <hi>Spain,</hi> they likewiſe forbid all
other Nations bringing into their Country any Proviſions, or other
Commodities whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, from <hi>Spain,</hi> declaring, that all that did
ſo ſhould be eſteemed <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Partiſans, and be treated as
Enemies. A Copy of this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the States-General was ſent to all
Princes, that they might not pretend Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>France</hi> came into the <hi>Dutch</hi> Scheme, and declared,
that if after 6 Months any of her Subjects ſhould trade with <hi>Spain,</hi>
they would, in ſo doing, expoſe themſelves to ſuch Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies, as
the Crown would not concern <pb n="83" facs="tcp:56197:51"/>it ſelf to remedy; and the
other Powers like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe acquieſced to this bold Declaration.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding theſe ſevere Prohibitions of the
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> the <hi>Dutch,</hi> as before, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to all the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Countries, by means of Paſſports, the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
themſelves gave them for Money, which they often wanted to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on their
Affairs. In ſhort, the Truce of twelve Years was concluded between
<hi>Spain</hi> and the <hi>United Provinces</hi> in the Year 1609, and by it
the Freedom of Trade was re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd between the two Nation; and
amongſt other things it was agreed, That the Traders of each Nation ſhould
pay no greater Duties, than the Inhabitants or Allies of ſuch Nations who
paid the loweſt Cuſtoms; and that the <hi>Dutch</hi> might be ſecured
from apprehending any thing from the Inquiſition, it was agreed, that they
ſhould enjoy the ſame Liberty as was ſtipulated to the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
ſome time before, in the Articles of the Treaty of <hi>Velaſco,</hi> which
the Conſtable of <hi>Caſtile</hi> had made with the Crowns of
<hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The War that was revived in the Year 1621, after the Expiration of
that Truce, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted the Trade of both Nations till the Year 1648, when
they concluded a perpetual Peace at <hi>Munſter;</hi> and from that time the
Trade the <hi>Dutch</hi> drove with <hi>Spain</hi> became much more
conſiderable than ever, by reaſon of thoſe Privileges that Crown yielded
to them <pb n="84" facs="tcp:56197:52"/>in that Treaty. Thoſe great Advantages they
offered the United Provinces, was one of the principal Means they made uſe of
to draw the States from the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt, and to make a Separate
Peace with them, and which in Effect, was the ſaving of that Monarchy.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> Trade with <hi>Spain</hi> continued from that
time till now, that is, till the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of this preſent War, which
began in the Year 1702, on Account of the Partition Treaty which was deſigned
to exclude <hi>Philip</hi> V. the preſent King, from ſucceeding
<hi>Charles</hi> II. whoſe lawful Heir and Succeſſor he was. It is worth
while to obſerve, how Reaſons of State have united theſe two Nations, the
moſt averſe to each other in the World, and whoſe hatred eſpecially
that of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſeemed irreconciliable.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> favour'd the <hi>Dutch</hi> in their Trade as
much as they poſſibly could, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly ſince the Year 1667, in hopes
to have ruined that of the <hi>French,</hi> and they were not unſucceſsful
in that reſpect; but the <hi>Dutch</hi> Trade never flouriſh'd ſo much in
<hi>Spain</hi> as ſince the War between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi>
begun in the Year 1672, to the beginning of this preſent War; for they not
only furniſh the <hi>Spaniards</hi> with ſuch Goods as they uſed to have
from <hi>France,</hi> but furniſh themſelves like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe from
<hi>Spain</hi> with what <hi>France</hi> uſed to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply 
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56197:52"/>them with before the ſeveral Wars of 1672, and 1690.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> traded very much to all thoſe Places that were
ſubject to <hi>Spain,</hi> as <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Brabant, &amp;c.</hi>
before this preſent War, and which ſhe has now loſt, as well as thoſe
which the <hi>French</hi> loſt ſome time after, that is to ſay, during
the three laſt Campaigns: But their chief Trade of all was that of
<hi>Cadiz</hi> and in the Mediterranean. 'Tis in that famous Port of
<hi>Spain,</hi> where the Galleons are equipt out for <hi>Peru,</hi> and the
<hi>Flotilla</hi> for <hi>Mexico</hi> and <hi>New Spain,</hi> and which return
thither with their rich lading from thoſe Empires, and bring almoſt all the
Gold and Silver we ſee in <hi>Europe;</hi> however, tho' the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> are the Maſters of thoſe Countries where Gold and Silver
grow in ſuch abundance, yet it is very true that they have leſs of either
than thoſe Nations that Trade with them, which ſhews that Mines of Gold and
Silver contribute much leſs to the enriching of a Country than Trade and
Commerce.</p>
            <p>What follows, is a true Account of the Goods and Merchandize the
<hi>Dutch</hi> uſed to carry into <hi>Spain</hi> and bring thence, before the
laſt Rupture.</p>
            <p>That which they imported conſiſted chiefly of Linnen of all
ſorts, Woollen Stuffs, a great Number of Silks, Gold and Silver Stuffs, 
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:56197:53"/>Drugs, Spices, ſmall Iron Wares, Maſts and Timber.</p>
            <p>The Linnen brought into <hi>Spain</hi> by Foreigners, ever was
look'd on as the moſt conſiderable Article of that Trade, by reaſon of
its vaſt Conſumption both in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>America;</hi> the
<hi>French</hi> furniſh'd the <hi>Spaniards</hi> a long time with this
Commodity; I believe I ſhould not exceed the Truth, by affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that this
only Article of the <hi>French</hi> Commerce amounted every Year to about eight
Millions of Livres.</p>
            <p>The Linnens that the <hi>Dutch</hi> bring into <hi>Spain,</hi> are
generally of the fineſt ſort that are made in <hi>Overiſſel,</hi> and
about <hi>Douay</hi> and <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenciennes;</hi> they ſell them in
<hi>Spain</hi> by the Name of <hi>Lawns</hi> and <hi>Cambricks;</hi> they vend
likewiſe a certain kind of Linnen, call'd <hi>Perſeilles</hi> and
<hi>Brabant;</hi> it is very broad and coarſe, and ſerves the poorer ſort
of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to wrap up Goods in: Beſides this, they ſell a World of fine
and coarſe Callico ſtain'd in <hi>Holland</hi> with all ſorts of Colours,
which they make Uſe of both in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> for
Lining of Cloaths: I paſs by many other ſorts of Linnen of leſs Note,
which the <hi>Dutch</hi> bring into <hi>Spain</hi> in time of Peace, as well as
Table Linnen, Tapes and Filletings, both white and coloured.</p>
            <p>Their Woollen Stuffs are Drabs and Serges, Camlets of all ſorts,
fine and coarſe; theſe <pb n="87" facs="tcp:56197:53"/>Stuffs are all of their own
Manufactures, as well as what they call black <hi>Anacoſies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tho' this Article may appear very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, yet the
<hi>Dutch</hi> bring into <hi>Spain</hi> other Goods of a far greater Value;
the ſeveral ſorts of Silks which they bring in vaſt Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities amount to
prodigious Sums. The <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> uſed formerly to buy their Silks
from the <hi>French,</hi> but ſince the Eſtabliſhment of theſe ſorts
of Manufactures in <hi>Holland,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> have entirely loſt
that rich Commerce as well as that of Gold and Silver Brocades, which the
<hi>Dutch</hi> ſell much cheaper. 'Tis true, theſe rich Stuffs at firſt
were neither ſo well made, nor ſo beautified as thoſe made in
<hi>France,</hi> but they are now come to that Perfection in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
that there is but very little Difference. The <hi>Dutch</hi> and they only
furniſh <hi>Spain</hi> with Cinnamon, Cloves and Nutmegs, and ſuch like
Spices; they ſerve them likewiſe with Pepper, but the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
ſhare with them in that Trade. I have been aſſur'd, that one third Part
of the Cinnamon that the <hi>Dutch</hi> have from the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi>
is conſumed in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in
<hi>Peru,</hi> where their Chocolate makes a vaſt Conſumption.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> likewiſe diſpoſe of in <hi>Spain,</hi> a
conſiderable Quantity of Drugs from the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi> both for the
Apothecary and Painters Uſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:56197:54"/>I paſs over the Article of Musk, Civet,
Ambergreaſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which amount to no ſmall Sum: They carry
alſo into <hi>Spain</hi> ſmall Iron Ware work'd at <hi>Nuremberg,
Frankfort</hi> and <hi>Liege,</hi> Steel and Copper-work from <hi>Sweden,</hi>
Leather from <hi>Denmark,</hi> and <hi>Ruſſia</hi> Leather for Chairs and
Coaches; great Quantities of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and Cards which they uſed to have from
<hi>France,</hi> White and Yellow Wax. This laſt Article is ſo
conſiderable, that it is believed to exceed four Millions of Livres, as well
by the <hi>Dutch</hi> Accounts as thoſe of other Nations that Trade thither.
The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> eſpecially thoſe that live in the <hi>Indies,</hi>
conſume prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Quantities, their chief Delight being to illuminate their
Churches Sundays and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lydays.</p>
            <p>In the time of Peace the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have from
<hi>Holland</hi> Planks, Maſts, Cordage, Pitch and Tar, and almoſt every
thing that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for Shipping, beſides all ſorts of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition
and Proviſions, as Herrings, Salmon, Butter, Cheeſe and Corn (when there is
a ſcarce Year, as it often happens in <hi>Spain</hi>) I muſt not forget
Timber for building, nor that ſort of Wood they make Pipes, Barrels and Casks
of to carry their Wine and Oil in, to <hi>America.</hi> Theſe are the
principal Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties the <hi>Dutch</hi> bring into <hi>Spain,</hi> and which
they will again undoubtedly continue to do after the Concluſion of the
approaching Peace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:56197:54"/>One might add to theſe the Negro Trade, which
Slaves their <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Company fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
with for <hi>America;</hi> and this makes no inconſiderable Article in the
<hi>Dutch</hi> Trade.</p>
            <p>All theſe Commodities (very few excepted) are equally proper for
<hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>America;</hi> but the greateſt part is ſent into the
New World, and <hi>Peru</hi> alone makes a greater Conſumption than all
<hi>Mexico.</hi>
            </p>
            <p> 
               <q rend="inline"> 'It muſt be obſerv'd as a Matter of
Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that only the <hi>Spaniards</hi> can Trade to the <hi>Weſt

trade thither, either directly or indirectly—'</q> However, by means even
of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themſelves, they have found out the Secret to

            <p>The Galleons are deſign'd, as I hinted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, entirely for the
Commerce of <hi>Peru,</hi> which is by far the richeſt, and the
<hi>Flotilla</hi> for that of <hi>Mexico.</hi> The Galleons may ſail from
<hi>Cadiz</hi> at any time, but the Flotilla is oblig'd to depart in the Month
of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> to avoid the Stormy Winds that are very rife in the Gulf
of <hi>Mexico,</hi> during the Month of <hi>September.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe two Fleets keep the ſame way till they come to the
Iſlands of <hi>Antilles;</hi> thence the Galleons continue their Courſe
till they come to <hi>Cartagena,</hi> and at laſt to <hi>Portobello,</hi>
where is kept the famous Fair between the Merchants of <hi>Peru</hi> and
<hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:56197:55"/>The <hi>Flotilla</hi> on the contrary, takes its

            </p>
            <p>In coming back, the Galleons and Flotilla muſt meet and anchor at
the <hi>Havana,</hi> a very famous Port in the Iſle of <hi>Cuba;</hi> then
they ſail together thro' the Canal of <hi>Bahama,</hi> and keeping ſtill in

<hi>Cadiz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now I am treating of the Commerce of <hi>Spain,</hi> it will not

            </p>
            <p>What elſe the <hi>Dutch</hi> and other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons furniſh the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> with, is paid for in Money by the Merchants of
<hi>America,</hi> as well as of thoſe of <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The chief Merchandize of <hi>America</hi> is Gold and Silver,
Pearls, Emeralds, Cochinele, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digo, that which the <hi>French</hi> call Laine
de <hi>Vigogne.</hi> Quinquina, Cocoa, Vanilles, To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, Leather, Wood of
<hi>Campechy,</hi> and other conſiderable Commodities.</p>
            <p>The Gold and Silver come to <hi>Spain</hi> by the the Galeons and
Flotilla; but the Galleons as I ſaid before, being deſign'd only for
<hi>Peru,</hi> bring greater Quantities; 'tis chiefly from the Mountain of

            <p>
               <hi>Peru, Chili,</hi> and the new Kingdom of <hi>Grenada,</hi> are
the three Countries that produce the moſt Gold.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the ſeveral Mines of theſe two valuable Mettals, and
where every Day they make new Diſcoveries, which makes all the Nations of
<hi>Europe</hi> ſo eager to Trade with the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> in reality
this Commerce is the moſt profitable, the Returns being always in Gold and
Silver.</p>
            <p>Pearls, Emeralds, Quinquina, and Laines de Vigogne come with the
Galleons.</p>
            <p>For the moſt part they fiſh for Pearls, near the <hi>Terra

            </p>
            <p>The Mines of Emeralds are near <hi>Santa Fe de Bagota,</hi> in

            <p>Quinquina, from the Province of <hi>Quillio,</hi> which is

            <p>There is no leſs a Conſumption of Indigo for Dying Blues; the

            </p>
            <p>The Wood of <hi>Campechy,</hi> which is uſed in Dying Blacks,

            <p>The principal Merchandiſe of their own Growth, that the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> furniſh theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries with, are Wooll, Wines, Fruits,
Oils, Soap, Salt, Soude or Kalt, Iron and Steel.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wooll was ever in high Eſteem on Account of
its Fineneſs and Excellency; there is however, great Difference, the beſt
coming from the Provinces of <hi>Andaluſia, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentia, Caſtile,
Arragon</hi> and <hi>Biſcay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch,</hi> when they have a free Trade with <hi>Spain,</hi>
take off vaſt Quantities, it being abſolutely neceſſary in their
Manufactures of Cloth. The <hi>French, Italians,</hi> and even the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> themſelves lay out conſiderable Sums in this Commodity;
ſo that it may truly be ſaid, that the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wool is the
greateſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle in their Trade on this ſide.</p>
            <p>The Southern Parts of this Kingdom pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce great Quantities of
excellent Red and White Wines; the chief Ports where theſe Wines are
ſhipp'd off to Foreign Parts, are, <hi>Alicant</hi> and <hi>Malaga,</hi> in
the Mediterranean: Much more Red than White comes from Port St. <hi>Mary,</hi>
Port <hi>Real,</hi> St. <hi>Lucar,</hi> and <hi>Roſa,</hi> in the Bay of
<hi>Cadiz;</hi> but the greateſt Part of the Wines that grow about that Bay,
are White, and are commonly call'd <hi>Xeres</hi> Wines. <pb n="95" facs="tcp:56197:57"/>The <hi>Dutch</hi> lay out large Sums in theſe Wines, as well as in
Canaryand Brandies, ſince they bought none of the <hi>French.</hi> The
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> ſince this War, have ſold much more Wine than before;
for whereas during the Peace, in the Year 1691. the Duties run only for 3000
Buts, they have ſince riſen to 16000.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> take off likewiſe abundance of Olives from the
Iſland of <hi>Majorca,</hi> as well as from <hi>Sevil</hi> and
<hi>Malaga,</hi> beſides great Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Figs, Raiſins, Almonds, and
other dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Fruits. I have been well informed, that there is ſcarce a Year,
but they lade five or ſix Ships with theſe Goods, including Oran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
Limons and Capers.</p>
            <p>The Soaps of <hi>Alicant</hi> and <hi>Carthagena</hi> are always
eſteem'd the beſt of any. Soude or Kalt, which is an Herb that turns to a
kind of Stone, after being burnt, and which is uſed in making Soap and
Graſs, grows in large Quantities on the Coaſts of the Kingdoms of
<hi>Valencia</hi> and <hi>Murcia,</hi> and Foreigners take off a great deal
from both Places.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> were wont to lay out great Sums with the
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> for Iron and <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Salt; there is a world of
this Salt all round about the Bay of <hi>Cadiz,</hi> and the Iſland of
<hi>Iva.</hi> Iron is the Product of <hi>Biſcay</hi> and <hi>Navarre;</hi>
and as there is no better in <hi>Europe,</hi> ſo for that very Reaſon there
is every Year a great Conſumption of this neceſſary Metal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:56197:58"/>The <hi>Dutch</hi> every Year employ in the
<hi>Cadiz</hi> Trade about thirty Sail of Ships, beſides thoſe that unlade
themſelves at that Port, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue their Courſe to the Streights.</p>
            <p>They tell you, that at the times of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture and Arrival of
the Galleons, the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Veſſels, that trade to
<hi>Cadiz,</hi> commonly encreaſes to 15 or 20.</p>
            <p>The Ships that Trade to <hi>Cadiz</hi> (except thoſe laden with
Corn) go always without Convoy, tho' their Artillery and Lading be very
conſiderable, which makes other Nations often put their Goods aboard theſe
Veſſels, as well for Safety as Cheapneſs of Freight.</p>
            <p>They pretend that the <hi>Dutch</hi> receive every Return of the
Flotilla and Galleons about five Millions for Goods ſent to the
<hi>Indies,</hi> and near upon as much for thoſe ſold at <hi>Cadiz;</hi>
add to this the indirect Trade to <hi>America,</hi> actually carried on by the
Way of <hi>Curazao,</hi> an Article of no little Conſequence.</p>
            <p>I have only one Word more to ſay, and that is in relation to the
Trade the <hi>Dutch</hi> carry on with the Northern Parts of <hi>Spain:</hi>
They come into every Port, but the Traders of <hi>Bilboa</hi> and <hi>St.
Sebaſtian</hi> are they that deal moſt with the <hi>Dutch;</hi> the Port of
the former is the moſt conſiderable, being the Magazine of the Provinces of
<hi>Old Caſtille</hi> and <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> this Town by its Commerce
furniſhes theſe two Provinces with Woollen Stuffs, <pb n="97" facs="tcp:56197:58"/>Silks, Lace, Ribands, Hats, Paper, Small Wares and Iron Work, brought
thither by the <hi>Dutch;</hi> who likewiſe bring all things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
for Shipping, Salt and Corn, of which they conſume great Quantities in
thoſe Places, as well as in other Provinces on the Sea Coaſt.</p>
            <p>They bring much the ſame Goods to <hi>St. Sebaſtian</hi> as
<hi>Bilbao,</hi> which are again ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Navarre,</hi> the Country of
<hi>Guipuſcoa,</hi> the <hi>Aſturies, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From all this ſide of the Country the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities to be Exported
are Wool from <hi>Arra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, Navarre,</hi> and <hi>Old Caſtille;</hi>
excellent Iron from <hi>Guipuſcoa,</hi> where the Iron Mines chiefly are;
Nuts, Cheſnuts, Limons, Oran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Anchovies from <hi>Calica.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Trade of the Southern Parts of <hi>Spain,</hi> which are
waſh'd by the Mediterranean Sea, is chiefly at <hi>Malaga, Cartagena,
Alicant, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentia, Almarica</hi> and <hi>Majorca, &amp;c.</hi> which afford
all the Commodities I ſpoke of above; to wit, Wines, Oils, Olives, Raiſins,
Figs, Almonds, Aniſeeds, Salt, Soap, Soude or Kalt, and abundance of
excellent Wool.</p>
            <p>The Foreign Commodities which are moſt proper for this Country are
<hi>French</hi> Linnens made in <hi>Bittany,</hi> good Quantities of Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
and Silk Stuffs, Lace, Hats, Small Wares of every ſort, and Jewellers Work,

            <head>CHAP. XI. Of the Trade with <hi>Portugal.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>BEFORE <hi>Portugal</hi> and the Countries that Crown
poſſeſſed in <hi>Aſia, Africa,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica</hi> came to be
reunited in the Year 1580, to the Crown of <hi>Caſtille,</hi> under the Reign
of <hi>Philip</hi> II, the <hi>Dutch</hi> traded very much with
<hi>Portugal,</hi> and with a great deal of eaſe, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the
Difference of Religion and the great Severity of the Inquiſition; their
greateſt Trade was that of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> whence they Exported beſides
the Merchandize of the Country, that of the <hi>Eaſt Indies, Africa</hi> and
<hi>Brazil,</hi> all which at that time went only thro' the Hands of the
<hi>Portugueze.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But after that Union, the Trade that the <hi>Dutch</hi> drove in
<hi>Portugal,</hi> underwent the ſame Fate as in the other Provinces of the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy, that is, thoſe Gentlemen were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd of all
manner of Commerce whatſoever.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Portugueze</hi> having ſhook off the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the
<hi>Caſtilians</hi> in the Year 1640, one of the firſt things they did was
to ſtop the Conqueſts of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> which they were 
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:56197:59"/>continually making of the <hi>Portugueze</hi> Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories
in the <hi>Eaſt Indies, Africa</hi> and <hi>Brazil,</hi> being Subject to the
King of <hi>Spain.</hi> The new King ſent forthwith an Ambaſſador to the
<hi>Hague,</hi> to repreſent to the States General that the
<hi>Portugueze,</hi> as ſuch, never having any Difference with the <hi>United
Provinces,</hi> he ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly wiſh'd there might be eſtabliſh'd a good
Underſtanding between the two Nations, which would put them in a better
Condition to reſiſt the <hi>Spaniand,</hi> their common Enemy.</p>
            <p>The States General finding their Account in the Offers of the
<hi>Portugueze,</hi> a Truce for ten Years was ſigned between them in the
Year 1641, and included all the Countries belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the two Nations, as
well on this as the other Side of the Line: By this Truce it was agreed that
there ſhould be a free Navigation, and that each Party ſhould be Maſter
of thoſe Places they were in Poſſeſſion of at the time of
publiſhing ſuch Truce; which Truce was ſo ill obſerv'd by the
<hi>Dutch</hi> in the <hi>Indies,</hi> that the <hi>Portugueze</hi> were in
ſome Meaſure oblig'd to break it in the Year 1645, by an Inſurrection
they made in <hi>Brazil</hi> againſt the <hi>Dutch,</hi> whom they entirely
drove out of that Country. This occaſioned a new War in <hi>Brazil</hi>
between the two Nations, but it did not break out in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> till the
Month of <hi>October</hi> 1646, when the States General declar'd War in all its
Forms againſt the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> becauſe <pb n="100" facs="tcp:56197:60"/>he would not reſtore to their <hi>Weſt India</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany that
which his Subjects had taken from them in 1647; but this Affair was
endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to be accomodated by the Mediation of <hi>France</hi> and
<hi>Cromwel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The War between the Northern Crowns was the Cauſe that this
Negotiation lingred out till the Reſtoration of the King of <hi>England,</hi>
who reſolving to marry the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi> procur'd a
Peace between the two Nations by his Mediation; and a perpetual Peace was
ſigned by them accordingly, the 16th of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt,</hi> 1661.</p>
            <p>The Privileges the <hi>Portugueze</hi> granted to the <hi>Dutch</hi>
by this Treaty, in relation to their Commerce, gave them an Opportunity of
Trading very conſiderably in <hi>Portugal,</hi> parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly after the
<hi>French</hi> prohibited all Foreign Sugar and Tobacco, and the
<hi>Portugueze</hi> on their ſide prohibted all <hi>French</hi> Manufactures:
'Twas with theſe two Articles chiefly that the <hi>Portugueze</hi> paid for
all <hi>French</hi> Goods; but after the <hi>French</hi> left off taking
theſe from <hi>Portugal,</hi> the <hi>Portugueze</hi> would deal no more in
<hi>French</hi> Merchandize; this gave the <hi>Dutch</hi> an Opportunity to
furniſh them with theirs, taking in payment Sugar and Tobacco, which they
knew very well how to diſpoſe of.</p>
            <p>The Trade of <hi>Holland</hi> is chiefly at <hi>Lisbon</hi> and
<hi>Oporto,</hi> but the firſt is the moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: 
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:56197:60"/>As for <hi>St. Ubes</hi> where they go for Salt there is
very little or no Conſumption.</p>
            <p>The Goods they Tranſport to <hi>Portugal</hi> conſiſt chiefly
in great Quantities of Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures of Silk, Wool and Linnen, Small Wares and
Iron-work, Paper, Cards, Leather, Corn in time of ſcarcity (which is there
very frequent.) Of all ſorts of Merchandize except Corn, there is a vaſt
Conſumption in <hi>Portugal</hi> and its Colonies.</p>
            <p>The Goods they bring from <hi>Portugal</hi> are thoſe of the
Country or its Colonies, the latter conſiſt in Sugars, Tobacco, Wood of
<hi>Brazil</hi> and <hi>Fernambouc,</hi> Ox Hides, Ginger, Pearls, Indigo,
rough Diamonds, and Ambergreaſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tobacco and Sugar are the chief Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of <hi>Portugal,</hi>
Sugar is one of their richeſt Returns from <hi>Brazil,</hi> where it
wonderfully abounds: The Iſlands of <hi>S. Thomas, Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, Capo Verde;</hi>
and the <hi>Terceras</hi> alſo fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh conſiderable Quantities, but I am
of the Opinion not near ſo good, unleſs it be that of <hi>Madera;</hi> they
have alſo great Quantities of <hi>Brazil</hi> Wood, and other Woods for
Dying, Ambergreaſe (which comes from <hi>Melinda</hi>) Pearls and Diamonds
from the <hi>Eaſt Indies;</hi> this Merchandize is one of the greateſt
Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in the <hi>Portugal</hi> Trade.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:56197:61"/>The Merchadize of <hi>Portugal</hi> itſelf
conſiſts in Wines (amongſt which I ſhall reckon thoſe of
<hi>Madera</hi>) Oils, Olives, Aniſeeds, excellent Fruits, Raſins and
Figs.</p>
            <p>It is believ'd that the <hi>Dutch</hi> bring every Year from
<hi>Portugal</hi> ten or twelve Ships laden with thoſe Commodities, including
Limons and Oranges, without reckoning their dry'd Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meats made of ſeveral
ſorts of admirable Fruits in <hi>Portugal</hi> and <hi>Brazil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is ſaid, that they ſend every Year di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly into
<hi>Portugal</hi> above twenty Sail of Ships, beſides other Ships that Trade
in the Mediterranean, and come thence to <hi>S. Ubes</hi> for their lading of
Salt, of which they make a great Conſumption in the North, where it has been
very much in Uſe for a long time. The Commerce of <hi>Holland</hi> with
<hi>Portugal</hi> is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on by a Fleet of fifty Ships that are eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Year
conſtantly employ'd for that End, from fifteen to thirty Guns, with which
they do good Service againſt the Corſairs and Pirates.</p>

            <p>THE Trade of the Mediterranean Sea was heretofore the moſt
conſiderable in the World, when that of the <hi>Indies</hi> only paſt thro'
<hi>Alexandria,</hi> and ſome other Ports of <hi>Syria:</hi> This Commerce
was chiefly carry'd on by the <hi>French, Italians</hi> and <hi>Catalans;</hi>
but the <hi>Venetians</hi> were the moſt conſiderable of all.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Portugueze</hi> making themſelves Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Trade
of <hi>Aſia</hi> turn'd the Current, and the <hi>Italians</hi> and the

<hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>French</hi> have very little to do.</p>
            <p>The Trade of <hi>Holland</hi> to the Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean, is one of the
moſt conſiderable that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick enjoys, as well on Account of the 
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:56197:62"/>great Quantities of Merchandize they carry thither, and
vend at a high Price, as in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the vaſt Number and Quality of
thoſe Goods they have thence in return, and of which likewiſe they make a
conſiderable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit in the other Parts of <hi>Europe;</hi> for which
Reaſon the States-General are very careful and jealous of a Commerce ſo
advantageous to their Republick. They have eſtabliſh'd a Chamber, which
they call <hi>the Chamber of Direction,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd of ſix Deputies and a
Regiſter; all the ſubſtantial Merchants of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> who have
attain'd the Rank of Burgomaſters, have a particular regard to, and are much
intereſted in what concerns the Navigation and Trade of the
Mediterranean.</p>
            <p>This Chamber has Authority to ſee that all Orders from the
States-General, touching this free Navigation, and the Trade thereon
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending, be duly obſerved; and this Chamber takes Notice or Cognizance of
all Differences that may ariſe at any time, in purſuance of ſuch
Commerce: It regulates in ſome Meaſure, the Convoys that are neceſſary
for Merchants Ships, and nominates Conſuls for the Sea-ports of the
<hi>Levant,</hi> with conſent of the States-General.</p>
            <p>They ſend every Year about 10 Ships, that ſail from
<hi>Holland</hi> in three or four Squadrons, to trade in the Dominions of the
Grand Sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnior.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:56197:62"/>Their Veſſels of Freight cannot have leſs
than 20 or 25 Pieces of Cannon, and 60 or 70 Men each; and becauſe theſe
Voyages are very dangerous, by reaſon of the Corſairs of <hi>Barbary;</hi>
they allow them a Convoy of two Men of War of 50 or 60 Pieces of Cannon, and
160 or 170 Men.</p>
            <p>Theſe little Squadrons, both going and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, touch generally at
<hi>Leghorn,</hi> one of the beſt and moſt convenient Ports in
<hi>Italy;</hi> there they take in freſh Proviſions and Pieces of Eight,
things abſolutely neceſſary for an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous Trading Voyage to the
<hi>Levant.</hi> The <hi>Genoeſe</hi> who are always well provided with this
ſort of Money, are the People that furniſh them, tho' they very often
furniſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with it at <hi>Cadiz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are other <hi>Dutch</hi> Veſſels that go to ſeveral
Ports of <hi>Italy, Spain,</hi> and the Coaſts of <hi>Barbary,</hi> with
Merchandize which they diſpoſe of there, and then take in other Commodities
for the <hi>Levant,</hi> either on their own Account, or for the <hi>Italians,
French,</hi> &amp;c. and thence conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue their Courſe to the
<hi>Levant.</hi> The ſame Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod they take in returning; that is to ſay,
they ſell in thoſe Ports the Commodities they bring from the
<hi>Levant,</hi> and lade themſelves again with ſuch as they judge proper
for <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> either on their own or other People's Account.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:56197:63"/>Amongſt all the Ports the Grand Signior has
in the <hi>Archipelago, Candia, Cyprus, Rhodes, Greece, Aſia</hi> and
<hi>Egypt,</hi> thoſe of <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Smyrna, Aleppo</hi> and
<hi>Grand Cairo,</hi> are Places of the greateſt Commerce; but
<hi>Smirna</hi> exceeds them all, by reaſon of the Carravans of
<hi>Perſia,</hi> and the prodigious Number of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Veſſels that
reſort thither.</p>
            <p>This Town, is the very Centre of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> and
<hi>Dutch Levant</hi> Trade, and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Mart of their Cloths, which are
not only much admired and ſought after in the Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories of the Grand
Signior, but in <hi>Perſia</hi> and the greateſt Part of
<hi>Aſia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Trade of <hi>Egypt</hi> is by the way of <hi>Grand Cairo;</hi>
this renowned City is not only the general Magazine of all ſorts of
Merchandize, produced in that rich and vaſt Kingdom, but alſo of what comes
thither from the Coaſts of the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,
Perſia</hi> and <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia Felix,</hi> and ſome Provinces of
<hi>Africa:</hi> However, notwithſtanding all this, the Trade of <hi>Grand
Cairo</hi> is now only a Shadow, in Compariſon of what it was before the
<hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueze</hi> diſcovered the <hi>Eaſt-Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Trade of this Place with <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> is
carried on by the <hi>Nile; Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Rhodes,</hi> ſituated on
the two Entrances of that famous River, are the two Ports where ordinarily
reſort the Chriſtian Ships: <hi>Dami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etta,</hi> which lies in the
South-Entrance of the <pb n="107" facs="tcp:56197:63"/>ſame River, is frequented only by
the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>Turkey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is very little Conſumption at the two former Places, which
are to be conſider'd as Places of Staple for thoſe who trade to <hi>Grand
Cairo,</hi> which City is about Fifty Leagues diſtant; and that is the
Reaſon that the <hi>Dutch</hi> Trade in <hi>Egypt</hi> is very
inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
            <p>Beſides, the Miniſter the <hi>Dutch</hi> always have at the
Ottoman Port, whoſe principal Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to ſee the Articles of
Agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Nations put in Execution, and ſecure and protect
the Commerce of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick; they have their Conſuls and their
Vice-Conſuls, in the chief Ports of the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi> who do Juſtice to
the <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchants that live there, without any Fee, Salary, or
Perquiſite.</p>
            <p>The principal Merchandiſe that the <hi>Dutch</hi> carry to the
<hi>Levant,</hi> are Cloths of all ſorts, Spices, Cochineal, Indigo, Drugs,
Woods fit for Dying, Tin, Lead, Iron, Steel, Cotton,
<hi>Ruſſia</hi>-Leather, and Money both Gold and Silver.</p>
            <p>Their Clothes and other Woolen Stuffs have ever made the greateſt
Article of what the People of <hi>Europe</hi> are uſed to ſend into the
<hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant;</hi> the <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>French</hi> ſupply'd thoſe
Countries heretofore; but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> have long
ſince made themſelves Maſters of <pb n="108" facs="tcp:56197:64"/>that conſiderable
Trade; and it is ſaid, that thoſe two Nations ſend thither every Year a
prodigious Quantity of all ſorts, Qualities and Colours, great part of which
is preſently taken off by the Caravans of <hi>Perſia</hi> that come for
that very Purpoſe to <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and thence car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them to ſell in
their own Country, and <hi>Tartary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The great Fidelity and Exactneſs that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and
<hi>Dutch</hi> always keep in the Quality, Meaſure and Colour of their
Cloths, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to their cheapneſs, have been the principal Reaſon that this
Trade runs only thro' the hands of thoſe two Nations.</p>
            <p>The Spices the <hi>Dutch</hi> bring into the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant</hi> are
Cloves, Nutmegs, Cinnamon, Pepper; to which I ſhall add Ginger and Sugar;
'twas heretofore from the Ports of <hi>Syria</hi> they had all their Spices,
but now by a very ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Revolution of Commerce, the <hi>Dutch,</hi> a
People of the <hi>North,</hi> after a Navigation of many thouſand Leagues,
which they conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make to acquire this rich Merchandize, ſupply
thoſe very Ports with Spices which heretofore uſed to furniſh all
<hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> bring likewiſe into the <hi>Levant</hi> the
fineſt Woods and Drugs for Dying, as Cochineel, Indigo, Gumlac, Woods of
<hi>Brazil, Fernamboue, Siampan, Brazillet,</hi> and <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pechy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:56197:64"/>All theſe Commodities, and many others come
from <hi>Africa,</hi> except Gumlac and Siam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, which are the Product of the
<hi>Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They bring likewiſe thither a great deal of Steel, Iron, tin'd
Iron, Iron Wire, Braſs Plates, <hi>Ruſſia</hi> Leather, Lead and Tin: But
the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> whoſe Country produces theſe two laſt in
greateſt abundance, bring into the <hi>Levant</hi> much greater Quantities,
and the vaſt Conſumption that there is made, is none of the leaſt
Articles of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Trade: The Tin Men over all the Eaſt uſe
a great deal of it in Kitchin Furniture, which for the moſt part is made of
no other Mettal but Copper.</p>
            <p>Tho' the Money the <hi>Dutch</hi> make in <hi>Holland</hi> be
nothing near of ſo good Alloy as the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Pieces of Eight,
they go nevertheleſs in the <hi>Levant</hi> as well as the other: I omit here
ſome Commodities of leſſer Conſequence which the <hi>Dutch</hi> are
likewiſe uſed to bring into theſe Parts; all ſorts of Goods are well
enough re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived at <hi>Grand Caico,</hi> except fine Linnen and Spices.</p>
            <p>The greateſt part of the Commodities that the <hi>Dutch</hi> bring
from the Ports of the <hi>Levant,</hi> come from the Grand Signiors Dominions,
the reft from thoſe Ports where arrive the Caravans of <hi>Perſia</hi> and
<hi>Armenia,</hi> the chief of which Commodities are raw and ſpun Silks,
twiſted Goats and Camels Hair, Cotton, Callicoes, <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovan</hi> and
other Leather, colour'd Camblets, <pb n="110" facs="tcp:56197:65"/>Wax, Allom, Galls, Wool,
Boxwood, Tea, Coffee, Gurrants, Ultramarine, and all ſorts of Drugs for the
Apothecaries Uſe.</p>
            <p>The Silks that come from the <hi>Levant</hi> are for the moſt part
the Product of <hi>Perſia, Syria, Egypt,</hi> the Iſlands of the
<hi>Archipelago,</hi> and the <hi>Morea.</hi> But what the Caravans bring every
Year to <hi>Smyrna,</hi> far exceeds in Quantity that which comes from the
other Countries of the <hi>Levant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Caravans bring likewiſe a great deal of Goats Hair ſpun
at <hi>Angora</hi> and <hi>Debazar</hi> in <hi>Perſia,</hi> of which they
make the fineſt Camlets in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is ſaid that the <hi>Dutch</hi> every Year bring from the
<hi>Levant</hi> about 2000 Bales of Silk, and the like Quantity of ſpun Goats
Hair, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> take off almoſt as much.</p>
            <p>The Cotton that comes from the <hi>Levant</hi> grows chiefly in the
Grand Signior's Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Country about <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and in the
Iſle of <hi>Cyprus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are not ſuch Quantities in <hi>Perſia,</hi> but the
Caravans bring to <hi>Smyrna Indian</hi> Callicoes, and other Stuffs made of
Cotton, as Muſlins, and that which the <hi>French</hi> call
<hi>Cambreſines,</hi> which are very fine, and bear a good Price.</p>
            <p>They make in the Grand Signiors Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons a vaſt Quantity of
Cotton Stuffs, both blue and white, which are very excellent, and ſell 
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:56197:65"/>well, eſpecially the blue, which are Dyed to that
Perfection, that the Colour never ſtirs.</p>
            <p>The Article of <hi>Cordovan, Turkey</hi> Leather and common Leather
is alſo very conſiderable; there is a vaſt Conſumption in <hi>Italy,
France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and even in the North itſelf; theſe
<hi>Turkey</hi> Leathers are of ſeveral Colours, but moſt commonly white,
red, and yellow; this Commodity alone, is one of the greateſt Articles of the
<hi>Dutch</hi> Trade in the <hi>Levant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Trade for Drugs is no leſs, conſidering the great
Conſumption made in all Parts of <hi>Europe:</hi> Rhubarb and Scammony come
from <hi>Tartary,</hi> and are brought by the Caravans of <hi>Perſia</hi> to
<hi>Smyrna</hi> and <hi>Aleppo,</hi> together with Galbanum, Yppomenes,
Aromatick Gums, Tutia, and other Drugs.</p>
            <p>Grand <hi>Cairo</hi> likewiſe furniſhes ſeveral ſorts of
Gums and Drugs, <hi>viz.</hi> Frankincenſe, Sena, Caſſia, Aloes, Sal
Armoniac, and Tamarinds, Coffee, Pine Kernels, Oſtridge Feathers, and ſome
other Commodities of <hi>Egypt;</hi> I muſt not omit Maſtick, which comes
only from the Iſle of <hi>Chio,</hi> nor Currants, of which the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> make a great Conſumption, and are the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the
Iſles of <hi>Zante</hi> and <hi>Cephalonia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tho' the <hi>Dutch</hi> were the laſt that came to trade in the
Grand Signior's Countries, yet have they been treated no leſs favourably than
other Nations; on the contrary, they and the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who for a long
while ſince have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt <pb n="112" facs="tcp:56197:66"/>ſhared all that Trade of
thoſe Parts, are the moſt eſteemed and beſt treated, having paid for
many Years only 3 <hi>per Cent.</hi> while other Nations pay five. This,
together with the good Order and prudent Conduct of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and
<hi>Dutch</hi> in that Succeſsful Trade, has made them Maſters of it, while
the <hi>French</hi> carried themſelves after a different Manner.</p>
            <p>Beſides, this Trade is manag'd all over the Grand Signior's
Dominions, with the greateſt Eaſe and Proſit; for the Goods that are
Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, pay no more than three <hi>per Cent.</hi> and thoſe that are
Imported five <hi>per Cent.</hi> once for all; after that you may tranſport
them to any Province you pleaſe, ſubject to that Empire, without being
obliged to pay new Duties: For Example, a Bale of Cloth that has paid the
Cuſtom of Entry at the Port of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> may go out for
<hi>Conſtantinople</hi> Cuſtom free; and the Officers (whatever is ſaid
of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Extortion) are not over ſevere, for if any one
ſhould give it in that, a leſs Quantity of Goods entered the Port than
really did, and the Fraud ſhould be diſcovered, yet he would be acquitted
on paying the Overplus for what he had ſo concealed. By this it appears, that
the <hi>Turks</hi> underſtand better the Maxims neceſſary for the
flouriſhing of Trade, than other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions who look upon them as a barbarous
Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that inflame and carry Matters with a high hand in relation to
Delinquents in this <pb n="113" facs="tcp:56197:66"/>Kind by Confiſcations, Forfeitures,
and Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, odious to the People, and no ways ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to the
Prince.</p>

            <p>THE Trade the <hi>Dutch</hi> have with <hi>Italy</hi> is
conſiderably great; they carry thither great Quantities of <hi>Indian</hi>
Goods, and their own Manufactures, and bring thence a great deal of woven and
raw Silks, and other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts of that Country; they trade chiefly to the Ports
of <hi>Genoa, Leghorn, Venice, Naples,</hi> and <hi>Meſſina:</hi> Theſe
five Places, if I may uſe the Expreſſion, are the Staple Marts for all
Commodities that the other Ports of <hi>Italy</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Strangers with,
who on the other hand bring thither theirs, which are afterwards diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Genoa</hi> without Contradiction, is a Place of the greateſt
Trade, <hi>not only</hi> becauſe ſeveral Manufacturies flouriſh there,
and the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of that City trade much themſelves with their own

Account of the <pb n="114" facs="tcp:56197:67"/>Trade of all <hi>Lombardy</hi> with
Strangers, which muſt paſs thro' the Hands of the <hi>Genoeſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here follows an Account of the principal Goods the <hi>Dutch</hi>
carry into <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Pepper, Cloves, Nutmegs, Cinnamon, <hi>Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia</hi> Leather,
<hi>China</hi> Ware, Iron, <hi>Swediſh</hi> Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tin
and Lead, Whalebone, Pitch and Tar, Maſts, Planks, and other things
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for Navigation; Cloths, Serges, Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, <hi>Flanders</hi>
Thread, Stockfiſh, Pickled Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Caviard, Musk and Civet, Wheat and other
Grain (when there is a ſcarce Seaſon in <hi>Italy</hi>): All theſe Goods
are brought into the five Ports I juſt now mention'd, except Iron and Copper,
which muſt never come to <hi>Venice,</hi> no more than Cloths, which are
there Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited and Counterband, becauſe the Natives make great Quantities
themſelves and very good.</p>
            <p>The Commodities the <hi>Dutch</hi> carry out of <hi>Italy</hi> are
ſeveral ſorts of Silks, raw and twiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Woven Silks of all Kinds, as
plain and wrought Velvets, Tabbies, Sattins, Damasks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Gold and
Silver Brocades, Gold Thread, drawn and twiſted at <hi>Milan,</hi> Oil of
Olives, Parmeſan Cheeſe, Anchovies, Sauſages, dry'd Fruits, (as
Raiſins, Figs, and Almonds,) Lemons, and Citrons; Paſtes and Confections of
all ſorts, Rice, Anniſeeds, Allum and Sulphur, <hi>Venetian</hi> Steel,
Manna, Amber, Turpentine, Creme Tartar, fine Lacca, Glaſs of all ſorts,
white <pb n="115" facs="tcp:56197:67"/>Marble in Squares and Tables, Paper, Soap,

            </p>
            <p>One may likewiſe be furniſh'd at <hi>Leghorn, Genoa,</hi> and
<hi>Venice,</hi> with all ſorts of Goods from the <hi>Levant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Woven and Raw Silks are certainly the moſt conſiderable and
important Merchandize Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers export out of <hi>Italy,</hi> and are really
the Baſis and Foundation of the <hi>Italian</hi> Trade: Theſe Silks which
are of ſeveral ſorts come from <hi>Lombardy,</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> and
are chiefly made in <hi>Florence</hi> and <hi>Naples;</hi> the plain Velvets
are made at <hi>Genoa</hi> and <hi>Rheggio,</hi> the wrought ones which have

Grounds are made at <hi>Milan, Genoa, Venice, &amp;c.</hi> Sattins and Damasks
at <hi>Genoa, Bologna,</hi> and <hi>Lucca;</hi> (the white Sattins made at

and <hi>Florence:</hi> I paſs by a great many other <hi>Italian</hi>
Manufactures of Silk, very profitable, which the Brevity of this Treatiſe
will not admit of.</p>
            <p>It muſt be obſerv'd in general, that theſe Manufactures of

            <head>CHAP. XIII. Of the <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Trade.</head>
            <p>THE <hi>India</hi> Trade is of very great Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to the
<hi>Dutch,</hi> not only on Account of the Spices they are Maſters of, (which
rich Productions are equally eſteem'd and ſought after by the Inhabitants
of the old and new World;) but alſo becauſe this Trade has given them
Opportunities of conquering a vaſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of prodigious Extent, and
maintaining a ſtrong Force at Sea, which in ſome Meaſure makes them
ſole Arbiters of the Commerce and Trade of thoſe vaſt Regions.</p>
            <p>It is now above 2000 Years ago, that the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> and
<hi>Europe</hi> traded with each other; <hi>Ptolemy</hi> H. King of
<hi>Egypt,</hi> contributed moſt to cultivate this Commerce, by means of a
new Road he cauſed to be made in his own Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions from <hi>Copta,</hi> a
Town bordering on the <hi>Nile,</hi> to <hi>Muris,</hi> a Port on the <hi>Red
Sea;</hi> by Means of this Paſſage, the Carriage of all Commodities, as
well thoſe of <hi>India</hi> as <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> was manag'd with much
Eaſe and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency by the mutual Aſſiſtance of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of
<hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Grand Cairo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Auguſtus</hi> having made himſelf Maſter of
<hi>Egypt,</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> omitted nothing that might 
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:56197:68"/>ſerve to favour and increaſe the <hi>Indian</hi> Trade
in <hi>Egypt;</hi> and whereas before the <hi>Egyptians</hi> uſed only to
employ in that Affair twenty Ships in the Time of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> they
employ'd then a hundred and twenty; and this Commerce was ſo very
advantageous to the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> that by the Merchandize they brought
from the <hi>Indies,</hi> they got a hundred for one, or ten Thouſand <hi>per
Cent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> were Maſters of this Trade till the Reign of
the Emperor <hi>Heraclius;</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Arabians</hi> engroſs'd
it all, and they found it ſo Profitable and Advantageous, that they ſettled
themſelves in the <hi>Indies,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated there the
<hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion, which they profeſſed; the <hi>Indians</hi> in

Inclination.</p>
            <p>All the Merchandize of <hi>Aſia</hi> continued its old Courſe,
and came into <hi>Europe</hi> by the <hi>Red Sea</hi> and <hi>Alexandria;</hi>
as alſo by the <hi>Perſian Gulf,</hi> and then was carried in the Caravans
belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Perſian</hi> Merchants, to the Ports of <hi>Syria,</hi>
which likewiſe were in ſubjection to the Souldan of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Twas to theſe ſeveral Ports the <hi>French, Italians,
Catalans,</hi> and other Traders of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> uſed to reſort, to buy
the <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Spices and other Commodities brought thither by the
<hi>Arabians;</hi> which they again diſperſed all over <hi>Europe</hi> with
prodigious Profit; but <pb n="118" facs="tcp:56197:69"/>the <hi>Italians</hi> being the
neareſt, were thoſe that got the moſt riches, by this profitable
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce.</p>
            <p>The Eaſtern Trade continued to be carried on with <hi>Europe,</hi>
by the Ports of the Medite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean, till about the Year 1498, when the
<hi>Portugueze</hi> having ſailed round <hi>Africa,</hi> (a Thing before that
time never performed by Man) came to <hi>Calicut</hi> a Town in the
<hi>Indies,</hi> towards the end of the Month of <hi>May</hi> 1498, after
having ſpent 88 Years time in diſcovering that Paſſage; this Action
gained them greater Honour and Reputation than the <hi>Phenicians,
Carthaginians,</hi> and <hi>Greeks</hi> ever had, who never attempted ſo bold
a Voyage, tho' they were the firſt Inventors of Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Portugueze,</hi> when they arrived in the <hi>Indies,</hi>
found the <hi>Arabians</hi> very powerfully eſtabliſh'd in moſt Parts of
that Country, and Maſters of all the Trade, and who omitted nothing to hinder
theſe new Comers from ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling there. They not only ſtirred up the
greateſt and moſt powerful Kings of <hi>India</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, but
even the Souldans of <hi>Egypt,</hi> with whom, for a long time, they had very
ſharp and cruel Wars; but all the Power that theſe confederated Princes
could make againſt the <hi>Portugueze,</hi> did not hinder them from
accompliſhing their Deſigns; by their Valour and good Conduct, they made
themſelves <pb n="119" facs="tcp:56197:69"/>Maſters of the Trade of thoſe vaſt
Regions of the Eaſt, by conquering an incredible Number of the moſt
important Places, and throughly fortifying thoſe Conqueſts from <hi>Cape
Couran,</hi> on the Eaſtern Coaſts of <hi>Africa</hi> to <hi>China,</hi>
and by their Men of War which were continually cruiſing on thoſe vaſt
Seas; particularly on the Coaſts of <hi>Arabia,</hi> to hinder Commerce for
the future being carried on at <hi>Grand Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
and fixing it entirely at <hi>Lisbon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have here inſerted the Names of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Places that the
<hi>Portugueze</hi> poſſeſs'd on the Coaſts of <hi>Aſia</hi> and

            <p>The Caſtle <hi>de las Minaes</hi> in <hi>Guinea;</hi> the Towns of
St. <hi>Salvador</hi> on the Coaſts of the Kingdom of <hi>Congo,</hi> and of

Maſters of all the Commerce on the Weſtern Coaſts of <hi>Africa;</hi> and
the Fortreſſes of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fales,</hi> and <hi>Mozambique</hi> and
<hi>Quitou</hi> of the Commerce of the Eaſtern Coaſts. Beſides theſe,
they had the important Places of <hi>Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats</hi> and <hi>Ormats</hi> on the

<hi>Diu, Cochin, Canar, Oranganar,</hi> and <hi>Coular.</hi> They were
Maſters of four good Fortreſſes in the Iſle of <hi>Ceylan,</hi> which

            <p>The Fortreſſes they had in the Iſles of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, Amboina,
Ternate</hi> and <hi>Benda,</hi> made them likewiſe Maſters of the Clove
and Nutmeg Trade.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, they poſſeſſed on the Coaſts of <hi>China</hi>
the celebrated and important Town of <hi>Macar,</hi> and though they had no
footing in <hi>Japan,</hi> of which they were the firſt Diſcoverers; yet
they carried on a very conſiderable and rich Trade with the
<hi>Japoneſe,</hi> a thing, at that time and ſince, unknown in the old
World.</p>
            <p>Their Shipping, which are continually go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to, and coming from
<hi>Japan,</hi> bring thence a great deal of Silver and fine Copper; as alſo
Gold, Silk woven and raw, Porcelain, <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> Ware, Tin and Lead, from

            <p>THE <hi>Dutch</hi> for many Years furniſh'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with all
theſe rich Commodities I mention'd in the laſt Chapter at <hi>Lisbon,</hi>
where they ſufficiently abounded; but the Crown of <hi>Portugal</hi> in the
Year 1580, being united to that of <hi>Caſtille;</hi> the Severities they
ſome time after ſuffered in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Dominions under
<hi>Philip</hi> II. oblig'd them to abandon that Trade, and was the real
Cauſe of putting them on that great Undertaking of going themſelves to the
<hi>Indies,</hi> and there to furniſh themſelves directly with thoſe very
Commodities they uſed before to have from <hi>Portugal.</hi> The
inſuperable Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties of this great Enterprize, deterr'd them a long
while, and they knew not in the leaſt <pb n="122" facs="tcp:56197:71"/>the Navigation of
thoſe vaſt Seas they were to ſail over, and were as much Strangers to the
Language, Genius, and Commerce of the <hi>Indians:</hi> The <hi>Portugueze</hi>
always keeping theſe things very cloſe and private from the reſt of
<hi>Europe.</hi> But nothing troubled them ſo much as the <hi>Portugueze</hi>
Men of War, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Shipping that were continually ſailing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where on
thoſe Seas, and which they believ'd they could not poſſibly avoid.</p>
            <p>To ſurmount this Difficulty, they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to open a
Paſſage into <hi>China</hi> and the <hi>Indies</hi> thro' the North, but
the inſuperable Obſtacles they met with, by reaſon of thoſe prodigious
Rocks of Ice in the <hi>White</hi> or <hi>Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Sea,</hi> made them abandon
that Project as too dangerous. In ſhort, they took up a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to take
the ſame Route as the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueze;</hi> and accordingly ſome of the
moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Merchants of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> and <hi>Zealand,</hi>
fitted out from the <hi>Texel</hi> in the beginning of the Month of
<hi>April</hi> in the Year 1559, four Veſſels laden with Goods for the
<hi>Eaſt Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding all the Precautions, they took in this Voyage,
they found many rubs laid in their Way, eſpecially by the
<hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueze,</hi> who did all they could to ſtarve them; but for all
that, three of theſe Ships, (one of which, by the Sailor's Negligence, they
were forced to abandon) arrived in <hi>Holland</hi> in the Month of
<hi>Auguſt</hi> 1561.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:56197:71"/>This proving at leaſt a ſaving Voyage for
thoſe that were concerned in it, made them hope for better Succeſs for the
future; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Foundation they began to form ſeveral Companies in
<hi>Holland,</hi> to carry on the <hi>Indian</hi> Commerce.</p>
            <p>Nothing contributed ſo much to their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Succeſs in the
beginning of this Trade, as the favourable reception they met with from
ſeveral <hi>Indian</hi> Princes, ſecret Enemies to the <hi>Portugueze</hi>
on Account of their Pride, Tyranny, and indiſcreet Zeal of their
Miſſionaries, which raiſed them a great Number of Enemies, who for a long
time only waited for an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to declare themſelves againſt
them.</p>
            <p>An <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentleman (whoſe Integrity can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be
queſtion'd) ſays, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct was very prudent, never
undertaking any thing againſt the <hi>Indians;</hi> from whom they never
exacted any Contributions as the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueze</hi> did, but only contented
themſelves with eſtabliſhing their own Commerce, and ruining that of the
<hi>Portugueze.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe ſeveral <hi>Dutch</hi> Companies traded ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately to
the <hi>Indies</hi> till the Year 1602, when the States General judged it
proper to unite them, that they might be in a better Condition to defend
themſelves againſt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Portugueze,</hi> and to
attack them if Occaſion ſo required: Out of theſe ſeveral Companies was
formed that general <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Company, <pb n="124" facs="tcp:56197:72"/>which
alone for twenty Years together, could carry on the Navigation beyond the
<hi>Cape of Good Hope</hi> and the <hi>Streights</hi> of <hi>Magellan;</hi>
their Stock which was no more than about 6500000 Florins or Guilders, was ſo
well managed by theſe able Merchants, that they have entirely deſtroy'd the
great Empire and Commerce of the <hi>Portugueze</hi> in the <hi>Indies,</hi>
having poſſeſſed themſelves of both, and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on their ruine, a
State whoſe Power may vie with that of their Republick in
<hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> who ſettled firſt in the <hi>Indies,</hi>
contented themſelves to ſtand on the Defenſive againſt the
<hi>Portugueze,</hi> whenever they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd them, but ſeeing with all their
Policy and Addreſs, they could never obtain of them Permiſſion to trade
quietly to the <hi>Indies,</hi> the General Company reſolved to attack them
as briskly in their Turn, and put themſelves in a Condition to repel Force by
Force.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of the Year 1605, they ſeized upon the Fortreſs
the <hi>Portugueze</hi> had in the Iſland of <hi>Amboina;</hi> this was the
firſt ſolid footing the Company got in the <hi>Indies</hi> and that
Iſland to this very Day, is one of the chief Governments the Company has in
thoſe Parts.</p>
            <p>This firſt Conqueſt was follow'd by that of the other
<hi>Molucca</hi> Iſlands, and conſequently made them Maſters of the
Spices, the richeſt and moſt important Commerce of any in the World. They
had an Intention in the Year 1606, to <pb n="125" facs="tcp:56197:72"/>Poſſeſs
themſelves of the important Place of <hi>Malacca,</hi> but the obſtinate
Reſiſtance they found there, made them lay aſide the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that
Enterprize till another Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> finding by Experience, that it was
impoſſible to drive the <hi>Dutch</hi> out of the <hi>Indies</hi> by Force,
offer'd to make Peace with them, and acknowledge them a free People if they
would abandon the <hi>India</hi> Trade. How great ſoever theſe Offers were,
they made no manner of Impreſſion on the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily
refus'd them, and rather choſe to continue a long War (as it proved to be)
and which they entred into only to obtain their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty (which was then
offer'd to them on ſuch hard Conditions,) than to abandon the <hi>Eaſt
India</hi> Trade, and they did not ſign the Truce in the Year 1609, but on
Condition they ſhould trade freely to the <hi>Eaſt Indies</hi> in all the
Places they uſed to do during the War.</p>
            <p>Tho' the Company was oblig'd to continue the War in the
<hi>Indies,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſo ill ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the Truce, yet
that did no ways hinder them from ſtrenuouſly carrying on their Trade even
to the principal Places of the Eaſt, where before it was unknown and unheard
of; the Trade of <hi>Japan,</hi> which they ſettled in the Year 1611, was of
the greateſt Conſequence, and they knew ſo well afterwards how to
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it, that ſince the Year 1616, they are <pb n="126" facs="tcp:56197:73"/>the only
People in <hi>Europe</hi> that have any thing to do in thoſe Parts.</p>
            <p>The Fort which King <hi>Iſnagar</hi> gave them leave to build on
the Coaſt of <hi>Coromandel,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving skreen'd them from the Reſentment
and Inſults of the <hi>Portugueze</hi> of <hi>St. Thomas,</hi>
eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed firmly their Commerce there, and which is one of the moſt
conſiderable in the <hi>Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In 1609, they began to build their City of <hi>Batavia</hi> on the
Ruines of the ſmall Town of <hi>Iventra</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Java;</hi>
it was fortify'd by a Citadel, compaſs'd with a Wall and eighteen Baſtions,
which were ſo ſtrongly built that this Town afterwards held out three,
Sieges againſt the Kings of the Iſle of <hi>Java.</hi> As ſoon as
<hi>Batavia</hi> was finiſh'd, the General Company made it the Capital of all
their Territories in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and the Centre of all Commerce in thoſe
Parts; the <hi>Dutch</hi> General makes it the Place of his Reſidence, living
in the Citadel with his Court and Council.</p>
            <p>Since the Companies Trade ſo wonderfully encreas'd, and in a
ſhort time became the moſt conſiderable of all <hi>Aſia,</hi> the
<hi>Dutch</hi> made new Conqueſts; and the Kings of the Iſlands, and the
Coaſts of <hi>Aſia,</hi> ſtruck with the Succeſs and Grandeur of the
Company, ſoon came and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veted their Alliance. In Proceſs of Time, they
erected ſeveral publick and private Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings at <hi>Batavia,</hi> of
extraordinary Beauty and Magnificence, inſomuch that it is now, and has 
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:56197:73"/>a long time ſince been, the Wonder of <hi>Aſia,</hi>
both for its Beauty and Commerce; for there is never a Day, but you may ſee
Veſſels entering the Ports from <hi>Bengal, Siam, Malac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> the
<hi>Molucca</hi> and <hi>Philipine</hi> Iſlands, <hi>China,</hi> and all
other Parts of the <hi>Indies,</hi> not inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thoſe that come from
<hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Truce ending in 1621, the two Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <hi>viz.</hi> the
<hi>Portugueze</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> prepar'd themſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ves for War, both in the old and new World. Of all the
Advantages the <hi>Dutch</hi> got in the <hi>Indies</hi> over the
<hi>Portugueze,</hi> That in the Year 1640 was the greateſt, for in that very
Year the Company, in ſhort, made themſelves Maſters of the Town of
<hi>Malacca,</hi> and by that Conqueſt became Maſters of the moſt
conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Streight</hi> in all <hi>Aſia.</hi> In effect, it was one
of the moſt important Places the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueze</hi> had in the
<hi>Indies;</hi> its Situation was won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful for the Trade of <hi>China</hi>
and the <hi>Molucca</hi> Iſlands, and they always kept there a ſtrong
Garriſon, and a good Fleet, which ſtruck a Terror into all the Neighbouring
Iſlands.</p>
            <p>On thr 1ſt of <hi>December,</hi> in the ſame Year 1640, the
<hi>Portugueze</hi> ſhook off the <hi>Caſtillian</hi> Yoke, and made the
Duke of <hi>Braganza</hi> their King, who was acknowledg'd as ſuch not only
by all <hi>Portugal,</hi> but by all the States that Crown poſſeſs'd in
<hi>Aſia, Africa</hi> and <hi>America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the <hi>Portugueze</hi> were not at War with the <hi>Dutch,</hi>
but as Subjects to the King of <pb n="128" facs="tcp:56197:74"/>
               <hi>Spain,</hi> as ſoon
as they ceaſed to be ſo, they deſired an Alliance with the
<hi>Dutch,</hi> with whom, in the Year 1641. they concluded a Truce for ten
Years, for all Places belonging to each Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, both on this and the other
ſide the Line; There was to be a free Navigation for both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties every
where; and each was to remain in Poſſeſſion of thoſe Places they held
in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> at the time of publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Truce.</p>
            <p>This Treaty was not capable to put a Stop to the <hi>Dutch</hi>
Conqueſts; for notwithſtanding the Truce they had ſign'd, they made
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Maſters of the Towns of <hi>Gallo</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbo,</hi>
two of the principal Places the <hi>Dutch,</hi> or rather the
<hi>Portugueze</hi> had in the Iſle of <hi>Ceylan;</hi> and this put into
their Hands the whole Cinnamon Trade, and in ſome ſort made themſelves
Maſters of the Streights between the Iſle of <hi>Ceylan</hi> and Cape
<hi>Comorin;</hi> ſo that by theſe Means they govern the two moſt
pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Paſſages of <hi>Aſia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Portugueze</hi> being not able to have any Juſtice done
them, for the Infractions of the Truce thus made by the <hi>Dutch,</hi>
reſolv'd to do themſelves Juſtice, and accordinly made an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
and general Revolt in <hi>Brazil,</hi> which coſt the <hi>Dutch</hi> the
Loſs of all they poſſeſs'd in that Place, and almoſt ruined their
<hi>Weſt-India</hi> Company.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:56197:74"/>The War alſo broke out in good earneſt
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Nations in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and laſted 16 Years; in
which time the <hi>Dutch</hi> took from the <hi>Portugueze</hi> almoſt all
the Trade they had left in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The taking of ſeveral Caſtles and ſtrong Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by the
<hi>Dutch</hi> in 1661. belonging to the <hi>Portugueze,</hi> from the Entrance
of the <hi>Indian</hi> Seas as far as <hi>Suratte,</hi> ſtruck ſuch a
Terror in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that vaſt Country, that the City of <hi>Goa</hi> was afraid they
muſt have fallen under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company.</p>
            <p>They got beſides, a Battle near <hi>Dabuls,</hi> the
Conſequences of which were very fatal to the <hi>Portugueze,</hi> for
ſeveral little Kings on this ſide the <hi>Ganges,</hi> following always the
ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſide, left the <hi>Portugueze</hi> to put themſelves under
the Protection of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who by reducing the Town and Iſland of
<hi>Medaea</hi> (which was oblig'd to be abandon'd to them) ſaw themſelves
Maſters of the Streights of <hi>Chilas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Expence and Trouble the Company were at during this War, did not
hinder them from taking all Methods to advance their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce. In the Year
1653, they made a new Eſtabliſhment at the <hi>Cape of Good Hope,</hi> for
the Conveniency of their Shipping that ſhould make the Voyages of
<hi>India.</hi> There is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent a great Town, and a Fort with 6
Baſtions, that commands all the Road. The Air is very <pb n="130" facs="tcp:56197:75"/>good, plenty of all ſorts of Game, and the Soil produces good Corn
and Wine; ſo that that this Port is of the greateſt Benefit and Advantage
to their Fleets which here take in freſh Proviſions.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the ill Succeſs that the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company
met with in the ſeveral At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts they made to ſettle their Commerce with
<hi>China,</hi> they was reſolv'd in the Year 1655, to make a greater than
ever, by ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thither a ſplendid Embaſſy with rich Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents for
the Emperor of <hi>Tartary,</hi> who was then Maſter of the Empire of
<hi>China.</hi> It was believ'd they would have carried their Point,
notwithſtanding the Stratagems of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and
<hi>Portugueze,</hi> who both paid dear enough afterwards for the ill Services
they did the <hi>Dutch</hi> on that Occaſion.</p>
            <p>This ſame Company ſuffer'd yet a more troubleſome
Mortification in the Year 1661, where they were driven by Force out of the
Iſland of <hi>Formoſa,</hi> which lies between <hi>China</hi> and
<hi>Japan.</hi> This Loſs was very conſiderable, in relation to the great
Trade they drove with both theſe Empires.</p>
            <p>In the ſame Year 1661, the <hi>Portugueze</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi>
being both wearied by a War ſo pernicious to them both, ſigned a Peace at
the <hi>Hague</hi> by the Mediation of the Kings of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:56197:75"/>By this Treaty, the <hi>Dutch</hi> quitted
<hi>Brazil</hi> entirely to the <hi>Portugueze</hi> for a good Sum of Money,
and ſome Advantages in reſpect of Trade. The Jealouſy afterwards between
the Viceroy of <hi>Goa,</hi> and the General of <hi>Batavia</hi> grew ſo
great, that this Peace was not at all obſerv'd in the <hi>Eaſt
Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Year 1663, the <hi>Dutch</hi> took from them the beſt
Places they had on the Coaſts of <hi>Malabar,</hi> viz. <hi>Coulan, Cananor,
Cochin</hi> and <hi>Grandanor.</hi> Thus in leſs than the ſpace of one
Year, almoſt 150 Leagues of the Country on the Coaſt of <hi>Malabar</hi>
exchang'd their Governors, and from the <hi>Portugueze</hi> came under the
Dominion of the Company, which much augmented their Commerce in the Provinces
of <hi>Guzaratte, Indoſton</hi> and <hi>Bengal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Portugueze</hi> were not the only People the Company fell
out with, they had ſeveral Wars with the <hi>Indian</hi> Kings, but that
againſt the King of <hi>Macaſſar</hi> was one of the longeſt and moſt
difficult they ever knew in that Country; the Subjects of that Prince, a hardy
and warlike People, rob'd and murder'd not only the Servants and Friends of the
Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but embarraſs'd much their Spice Trade; and there was good reaſon
to believe the King himſelf ſhar'd part of the Spoil: But at laſt the
Company attack'd him with ſo much Vigour, and ſuch conſiderable Force,
that they oblig'd <pb n="132" facs="tcp:56197:76"/>him to beg Peace on ſuch Conditions as
the Council of <hi>Batavia</hi> thought fit to impoſe on him by the Treaty of
1669, by which that King was oblig'd to give up, amongſt other
Fortreſſes, that of <hi>Macaſſar;</hi> and thus that Powerful Nation
was entirely ſubdued, and the Company by that means freed from the moſt
dangerous Enemies they ever had in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> and became abſolute
Maſters of the Trade of the <hi>Molucca</hi> Iſlands, which had been very
much troubled and interrupted ſeveral Years by the Incurſions and
Intelligence of the <hi>Macaſſarians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After a long Series of Proſperity and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, they ſent
their Troops in the Year 1675, into the Town of <hi>St. Thomas</hi> on the
Coaſt of <hi>Coromandel,</hi> having aſſiſted the King of
<hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conda</hi> to retake his Country from the <hi>French,</hi> who had
ſome Years before poſſeſs'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of it.</p>
            <p>About the Year 1680, the Emperor <hi>Mata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem</hi> in the Iſle of
<hi>Java,</hi> deliver'd up to the Company the Towns of <hi>Tapara</hi> and
<hi>Cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban,</hi> both (if I miſtake not) lying on the ſame Coaſt as
<hi>Batavia,</hi> for the Aſſiſtance they lent him againſt his two
Brothers that had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell'd againſt him, by which that Prince grew very
powerful in their Dependencies. In the Year 1682, we heard in <hi>Europe</hi>
that they had likewiſe made themſelves Maſters of the Town of
<hi>Bantam,</hi> which ſubmitted themſelves in the <pb n="133" facs="tcp:56197:76"/>ſame manner as the Iſle of <hi>Java.</hi> This Town is ſituated
in the middle of a Bay, which has a Road, one of the fineſt, ſafeſt and
moſt convenient of any in the <hi>Indies,</hi> both for coming in and going
out.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bantam</hi> was a Town of Trade, eſpecially for Pepper, and
all the Merchants of <hi>Europe</hi> uſed to trade thither; but ſince it
has fallen into the <hi>Dutch</hi> hands, no body has Liberty to come into that
Port, all the Trade being trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd to <hi>Batavia.</hi> This Affair
occaſion'd great Heats in <hi>Europe</hi> between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and
<hi>Dutch;</hi> the former, not bearing to ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves excluded one of
the chiefeſt Places where they had ſo many Years eſtabliſh'd their
<hi>Indian</hi> Trade, accus'd the <hi>Dutch</hi> of having by their Artifices
occaſioned the <hi>Bantam</hi> War, to make themſelves Maſters of the
Iſle of <hi>Java,</hi> and thereby to engroſs to themſelves all the Trade
of the <hi>Indies,</hi> excluſive of all the other Nations of
<hi>Europe:</hi> This Quarrel after ſome Years, was at laſt put an end to
by the Treaty of ....</p>
            <p>By theſe Ways the <hi>Dutch</hi> have eſtabliſh'd themſelves
in the <hi>Indies,</hi> but chiefly by taking away from the <hi>Portugueze</hi>
almoſt all their Commerce, and their beſt Places in that Country: They have
often attempted to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize <hi>Goa</hi> and <hi>Diu,</hi> which are all
they have now left them of any Importance, and which <pb n="134" facs="tcp:56197:77"/>ſooner or later 'tis thought, the <hi>Dutch</hi> will
accompliſh.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now diſcourſe of the Way and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how they manage
their Trade with the <hi>Indies,</hi> but firſt it will not be unuſeful to
give an Account of the Number of the Places, and of their chief Trade and
Exchange which is chiefly manag'd in theſe happy Climates.</p>

            <head>SECTION IV. Of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Trade in ſeveral Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
in <hi>Aſia.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE <hi>Dutch</hi> Trade to the <hi>Indies</hi> does not barely
conſiſt in bringing Goods into <hi>Aſia</hi> from <hi>Europe,</hi> and
tranſporting thence others in Exchange, but often in carrying the very
Commodities of <hi>Aſia</hi> to be ſold in other Parts of <hi>Aſia</hi>
itſelf; that is, for Example, to carry the Commodities of the Kingdom of
<hi>Siam</hi> and <hi>China</hi> into <hi>Japan,</hi> and thoſe of
<hi>Japan</hi> into thoſe Parts of <hi>Aſia</hi> where they are moſt
neceſſary. 'Tis by this Circulation which they make all over the Eaſt, as
well in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Commodities of <hi>Europe</hi> as <hi>Aſia,</hi>
that they ſufficiently provide themſelves with thoſe they ſend into
<hi>Holland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:56197:77"/>Here follows an Account of what this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
tranſports into <hi>Europe</hi> from the <hi>Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mocca</hi> on the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> two Leagues diſtant from
the <hi>Streights</hi> of <hi>Babelmandel,</hi> is where the <hi>Dutch</hi>
have chiefly their free <hi>Arabian</hi> Trade, which is very profitable to
them, by reaſon of the Spices the <hi>Arabians</hi> take from them in vaſt
Quantities, and have in return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other things, Frankincenſe, Myrrh,
and many other Gums, Manna, Balſam, or Balm, Aloes, Dragons Blood, (which
laſt is the Product of the Iſle of <hi>Jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>retara,</hi> not far from <hi>Arabia</hi>) Coffee, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
They likewiſe fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the other Ports of <hi>Arabia,</hi> as <hi>Adem,
Zebit, Maſcalle</hi> and <hi>Balzora,</hi> where they drive ſome ſmall
Trade, either on their own Account or the <hi>Indians,</hi> who ſend a
conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Quantity of their Commodities to <hi>Arabia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Perſian</hi> Trade with Foreigners is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on by the
Port of <hi>Gameron</hi> or <hi>Bandara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſi,</hi> which is the only
conſiderable Port of that Empire on the <hi>Indian</hi> Sea, being ſituated
at the Entrance of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Gulf, oppoſite to the Iſle of
<hi>Ormutz,</hi> ſo famous for its Trade when ſubject to the
<hi>Portugueze.</hi> The princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Trade of the <hi>Dutch</hi> is in the
ſaid Town of <hi>Gameron,</hi> upon which depends that of
<hi>Iſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han,</hi> where they pay no Cuſtom for Entry or going out in
<hi>Perſia,</hi> taking every Year 6000 Bales of Silk at a certain Price. But
as that Commodity is not very gainful in <hi>Europe,</hi> they 
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:56197:78"/>have leſſened that Quantity as much as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible;
inſomuch that in the Year 1664, they only took half what they uſed to
do.</p>
            <p>Silk is the moſt conſiderable and plentiful Commodity that comes
from <hi>Perſia,</hi> and this they work up all manner of ways, wrought and
plain, in Gold and Silver Brocades, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets and Hangings incomparably rich,
and extreamly beautiful.</p>
            <p>They bring likewiſe from <hi>Perſia,</hi> Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Wool (which
is wonderful fine) Pearls and Turquois Stones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Commodities the Company ſends thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and which they own
they gain moſt by, (that which they bring thence being not very profitable)
are Spices, Sugar, Aniſeeds, Gin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Indigo, Siampan Wood, Vermillion,
Frankincenſe, Benzoin, Quickſilver, Lead, Tin, Copper, colour'd Cloths,
Linnen from <hi>Suratte</hi> and <hi>Coromandel,</hi> and Piaſters or Pieces
of Eight.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> Trade in the Great <hi>Mogul</hi>'s Country, is
one of the richeſt they have in <hi>Perſia;</hi> they bring thence great
Quantities of all ſorts of Silks, Indigo, Salt-peter, Lacca, Agates, and
Ginger.</p>
            <p>All theſe Commodities do not only ſell well in <hi>Europe,</hi>
but are much eſteem'd and ſought for in <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi>
itſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:56197:78"/>
               <hi>Suratte,</hi> the only Sea-Port in theſe
Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, is their Place of greateſt Trade: In this Place one may find all
ſorts of Commodities produced in the Great <hi>Mogul</hi>'s Dominions,
ſufficient to ſupply the other Parts of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and
<hi>Africa,</hi> and even <hi>Europe</hi> itſelf, and which are tranſported
thither by the <hi>Engliſh, Dutch, Perſians, Portugueze, Moors</hi> and
<hi>Indians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> Company ſend chiefly thither, Spices, Pepper,
Copper, Tortoiſe-ſhell, Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire, Vermillion, Orchalmy, Tin, Benzoin, and
ſeveral ſorts of coloured Cloths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Coaſt from <hi>Suratte</hi> to Cape <hi>Comorin,</hi> and
which comprehends that of <hi>Malabar,</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes them chiefly with
Pepper; the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany who poſſeſs'd there a great many conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Places in the Year 1664 entered into ſeveral Treaties with the Kings of
thoſe Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons, whereby they engaged to ſell them all their Pepper.</p>
            <p>They bring from the Coaſt of <hi>Coromandel,</hi> (in which I
include the Kingdom of <hi>Golconda,</hi>) great Quantities of Cotton and
Callicoe of all ſorts; that which they call Chints, (which is painted with
ſeveral Colours,) is moſt valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of any that is made in the
<hi>Indies,</hi> for the Colours never wear out, but laſt as long as the
Cloth it ſelf.</p>
            <p>The Kingdom of <hi>Golconda</hi> alſo yields Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, Bezoar
Stones and yellow Diamonds.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:56197:79"/>The Coaſt of <hi>Coromandel</hi> is the
moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant to the Company; in the Year 1663 they brought thence as many
Goods as coſt two Millions and four hundred Thouſand Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rins or Guiders,
and which conſiſted chiefly in Callicoes, part of which was ſent to
<hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the reſt to <hi>Perſia</hi> and <hi>Turkey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch,</hi> to ſecure themſelves the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of the
Coaſt of <hi>Coromandel,</hi> carry thither Spices, Copper of <hi>Japan,
Malacca</hi> Tin, and Gold Oar from <hi>Sumatra,</hi> Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver,
Vermillion, Camphire, Elephants Teeth, Siampan and Sandal Wood.</p>
            <p>The Kingdom of <hi>Bengal</hi> which belongs to the Great Mogul, is
one of the largeſt and moſt fruitful Provinces of <hi>Aſia;</hi> Silk,
Salt-Peter, and Sugar, are produced here in great Plenty; the Silk is look'd
upon to be the beſt in all <hi>India;</hi> the Village of
<hi>Cazambazar,</hi> and the Neighbouring Villages, can furniſh 32000 Bales,
100 Pound Weight each, the <hi>Dutch</hi> generally take ſix or 7000 Bales,
and would more, were they permitted; part they ſend into <hi>Europe,</hi> the
reſt they trade with to <hi>Japan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Saltpeter Trade is very conſiderable, for that Commodity is
here produc'd in great Plenty, and there is no better in the World.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> have a Magazine or Place for Stores at
<hi>Choupar,</hi> four Leagues below <hi>Patua,</hi> where they refine
Saltpeter; for if it be not <pb n="139" facs="tcp:56197:79"/>refined and made
tranſparent, 'tis of little Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue; and when it is refined, 'tis three times
dearer than before: But beſides this, the <hi>Dutch</hi> bring from
<hi>Bengal</hi> ſeveral ſorts of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Silks, and other Silk works,
Callicoes, Musk, and fine Rhubarb; theſe two laſt come from the Kingdom of
<hi>Boutan,</hi> lying on the North of <hi>Bengal:</hi> The <hi>Dutch</hi>
bring hither Spices, Copper, Tin, Lead, Quickſilver, Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>million, Elephants
Teeth, Siampan and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal Wood, Cloth, Coral and Amber.</p>
            <p>All theſe Commodities are very gainful. The Company, the better to
carry on this important Commerce, have ſeveral Store-houſes in <hi>Bengal.
Ongly,</hi> which is the chief Port, has a Magazine built all of Free-ſtone,
defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by 4 Baſtions, and a Fort, with good Ditches, mounted with 12
Pieces of Cannon; and tho' this Place is 30 Leagues diſtant from the Mouth of
the River <hi>Ganges,</hi> Ships never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs ſail thither, by the Care
they have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to facilitate that Navigation.</p>
            <p>The Trade of the Kingdoms of <hi>Pegu, Siam,</hi> and the Point of
<hi>Malacca,</hi> is likewiſe very conſiderable: The firſt of which
yields Lacca, Gold, Silver, Rubies and Sapphires.</p>
            <p>They bring to theſe Places, Spices, Pepper, Sandal-Wood, Callicoes
from <hi>Golconda</hi> and <hi>Bengal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Siam</hi> is a large Kingdom, well peopled, and produces
abundance of Rice, Elephants <pb n="140" facs="tcp:56197:80"/>Teeth, Tin, Lead,
<hi>Siampan</hi> Wood, which (is a good Commodity in all Parts of
<hi>India</hi>) as well as Deer-ſkins, which they trade with to
<hi>Japan:</hi> Here is alſo a great Quantity of Gold, and the fineſt and
moſt beautiful Porce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> take theſe Goods, and in return bring to
<hi>Siam,</hi> Spices, Pepper, Amber, Red Coral, Quickſilver, Sandal Wood,
Cloves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Company, by a particular Priviledge they have, excluſive of
all other Nations, bring hence <hi>Ligor</hi> Tin which they ſell to
ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Parts of the <hi>Indies</hi> and <hi>Europe</hi> at a good
Price.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Siam,</hi> as powerful as he is trades very much,
and ſends out Merchant Ships to ſeveral Parts of the <hi>Indies,</hi> and
even to <hi>Japan,</hi> which makes <hi>Siam,</hi> his Capital City, very
Famous for Traffick.</p>
            <p>The Trade of the Point of <hi>Malacca</hi> is very conſiderable;
the Company, by means of this important Place, do what they pleaſe in the
Streights of <hi>Malacca</hi> and the neighbouring Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>viz. Jor,
Ligor, Jambi, Queda, Pera, Sumatra,</hi> &amp;c. in which there is a great vent
for the rich Carpets of <hi>Bengal,</hi> and ſeveral ſorts of Callicoes of
the Coaſt of <hi>Coromandel:</hi> They bring thither alſo, Pieces of Eight;
and have in return, eſpecially at <hi>Queda, Pera</hi> and <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor,</hi>
good Quantities of Lead and Tin, two very neceſſary Commodities, and very
profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table <pb n="141" facs="tcp:56197:80"/>in the Company's Trade, eſpecially at
<hi>Bengal</hi> and <hi>Perſia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The chief Riches of the Kingdom of <hi>Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin</hi> conſiſt in
Silks, which is highly eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and very beautiful, Musk, Lignum Aloes,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and by theſe the Traders of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and the
<hi>Dutch,</hi> gain a great deal of Gold from <hi>China,</hi> and Silver from
<hi>Japan.</hi> The <hi>Dutch</hi> take off great Quantities of all theſe
Commodities in Exchange of their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Quickſilver, Vermillion, Amber and
Cloth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>China</hi> Trade was always looked on to be the richeſt of
all <hi>Aſia,</hi> on Account of the Value and great Quantites of Merchandize
tranſported thence.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Portugueze</hi> are the only Nation of <hi>Europe</hi> that
have been permitted to ſettle at <hi>Macar,</hi> and trade openly in
<hi>China.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Year 1686, they were ſtill the only People that enjoy'd
that Priviledge. I have been informed, by Perſons that ſeem'd to be well
vers'd in theſe Affairs, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> come
into certain Ports of <hi>China,</hi> where they trade by the Authority of the
Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the Province, neither of them ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any Intereſt or Acceſs
to the Emperor's Court, as the <hi>Portugueze</hi> have.</p>
            <p>From the very firſt time that the <hi>Dutch</hi> came into the
<hi>Indies,</hi> they try'd all they could to eſtabliſh their Commerce in
<hi>China,</hi> but <pb n="142" facs="tcp:56197:81"/>have ever been unſucceeſsful in
their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts.</p>
            <p>They conceiv'd, in the Year 1685, great Hopes to bring it to paſs;
there flew about a Report, that the Emperor being in peaceful
Poſſeſſion of all <hi>China,</hi> in the Deſign he had to make Trade
flouriſh, was willing to permit all Foreign Traders to come and ſettle in
all Maritime Places in his Dominions: Upon which the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company
ſent an Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor to that Monarch, to deſire Liberty of Commerce.</p>
            <p>In <hi>November</hi> 1686, News came to <hi>Bata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi> that the
Ambaſſador was arrived in <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> and 'twas not doubted but he
would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh his Deſigns.</p>
            <list>

            <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>Sokiere</hi> are the only <hi>Chineſe</hi>
that go out of their own Country to trade: They go to ſeveral Parts of
<hi>India,</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to <hi>Batavia,</hi> where a good Number of them
have ſettled themſelves.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Chineſe</hi> are born for Trade; they are Enemies to
Sloth; they think nothing painful or troubleſom, when there is the leaſt
Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Gain: They are contented with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and what is eaſy to
be come at: They are very hardy and enterprizing, dextrous and induſtrious:
They have an extraordinary ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty of Spirit; and you muſt have all your
Wits about you not to be over-reach'd by them in Dealing, when they have a Mind
to it. 'Tis a common Saying with them, <hi>That all Nations are Blind in
Matters of Trade; that the</hi> Dutch, <hi>and no other, have the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of
one Eye, but for</hi> them <hi>they have two.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nothing ſhows more their Abilities in Trade, than their Canals and
Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Rivers one to another, to facilitate the Carriage of their
Proviſions and other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities from one Province to another, and their
other Conveniences; but the great Care they take to make Proviſions equally
cheap in all Places, contributes moſt to make Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize 
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:56197:82"/>bear a moderate Price, by conſequence to have a good
Vent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Japan,</hi> a Country unknown before the <hi>Portugueze</hi>
diſcovered it, is a Country of large Extent, where Strangers (that are
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to trade thither) make very great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages.</p>
            <p>While the <hi>Portugueze</hi> of <hi>Macar</hi> had this Trade,
amongſt other Commodities, they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried thoſe of <hi>China</hi> to
<hi>Japan;</hi> and in that Trade was expended every Year 1500000 Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres; the
clear Profits of which, in 4 or 5 Months time, amounted to 75 <hi>per
Cent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> Company began to trade there about the Year 1650;
and ſince the Year — when the <hi>Portugueze</hi> were entirely driven
out of that Country, the <hi>Dutch</hi> were the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly People of
<hi>Europe</hi> who were permitted to trade there, which they continue to do
with great Profit, but are under this hard Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint to live in the
Peninſula of <hi>Dizmia,</hi> near the Town of <hi>Nagaſaqui,</hi> and dare
not go out of that Peninſula, without the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour's Leave, on pain of
being cut to Pieces: The <hi>Japaneſe</hi> have ſuch ſtrict Eyes over
their Conduct, that they can do nothing but the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the Town knows
it, either by Spies, or Guards that are placed at the Gates of the Quarter they
inhabit; ſo jealous and diſtruſtful is that Nation, and this conſtraint
laſts 8 Months; and the Formalities that they are <pb n="146" facs="tcp:56197:83"/>forced
to obſerve the reſt of the Year, when the Shipping arrives for their
lading, is no leſs troubleſome than inconvenient.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> bring to <hi>Japan</hi> yearly, Silk, raw and
woven, in great quantities, Cloths, Two Hundred Thouſand Deer-skins, One
Hundred Thouſand raw Hides, a great deal of Hemp, Linnen, Wooll,
Quickſilver, Cloves, Pepper, Sugar, Musk, Camphire and Borax,
<hi>Siampan</hi> and <hi>Brazil</hi> Wood, <hi>China</hi> ware, Calembac,
E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lephants-Teeth and ſmall wares (ſuch as the <hi>Chineſe</hi> uſed to
bring thither:) Silver and Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, are the principal Commodities to bring
thence, and tho' Gold is there very plenty, yet it is prohibited to be carried
out of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>There are no Impoſts upon any Goods that come or go out of that
Kingdom. I cannot tell the Number of the Ships, the Company em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys in that
Commerce, but generally ſome come to <hi>Batavia,</hi> and the reſt to
<hi>Malacca;</hi> when the Company deſired ſo earneſtly, that they might
ſettle their Commerce with <hi>China,</hi> it was, becauſe ſuch Commerce
ſeem'd to be, not only of vaſt Advantage to them in Relation to their Trade
in <hi>Europe</hi> and the <hi>Indies</hi> in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, but of great
Conſequence to them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their Trade to <hi>Japan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This made One of their Governours-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral expreſs himſelf after
this Manner, upon <pb n="147" facs="tcp:56197:83"/>the Subject of the <hi>Japan</hi> Trade
in a Letter to the Company.</p>
            <q>If we could but hinder the <hi>Chineſe</hi> from trading to that
Country, there would every Year above Fifty Tun of Gold, or elſe the Value of
Five Millions to be got by their Silks only; for the Commodities they carry
thither yields 80 <hi>per Cent.</hi> Would to God we were the only People that
enjoy'd the Benefit of that happy Trade, and that the Mine of
<hi>Formoſa</hi> abounded with Gold. If my Hopes and Wiſhes could prevail,
thoſe that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the Company, will be well ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, for
they will enjoy all the Profits of the <hi>Indian</hi> Trade without ſending
any Money from Holland, which is all they have to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of God in their
Prayers.</q>
            <p>I have often heard ſay by thoſe who are of the Company, that
they would be too Rich, if they did not loſe ſome of thoſe Ships that are
employed in that Trade; for the <hi>Indian</hi> Seas are very
tempeſtuous.</p>
            <p>The Trade of the Iſle of <hi>Ceylan</hi> is entirely in the
<hi>Dutch</hi> Hands, being Maſters of all the Coaſts, by reaſon of the
ſtrong Places they poſſeſs in thoſe Parts: The King of <hi>Candi</hi>
holds the reſt of the Iſland, he was never yet Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd, nor Aw'd, either
by the <hi>Dutch</hi> or <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The beſt Cinamon is the principal Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity that Iſland
produces, there is beſides a great <pb n="148" facs="tcp:56197:84"/>Quantity of Elephants
Teeth, and other Goods of leſs Conſequence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sumatra</hi> is one of the moſt conſiderable Iſlands in
the <hi>Indies,</hi> and has ſeveral Kings, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom the King of
<hi>Achem</hi> makes the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Figure; the <hi>Dutch</hi>
notwithſtanding may be ſaid to be Maſters there, by reaſon of the
ſtrong Place of <hi>Malacca,</hi> which is only ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from it by a
ſmall ſtreight; and the Forts and Magazines they have in ſeveral Places
eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially towards the Weſt, they are likewiſe in Poſſeſſion of
a vaſt tract of Land: Beſides they have made themſelves Maſters of all
the Trade of the Iſland, by ſeveral Treaties ſigned with the Kings and
the other Sovereigns; by which they are obliged to ſell their Pepper and Gold
Duſt to no other Nation. Theſe are the chief Commodities of the Country, to
which may be added Camphire and Benzoin, theſe Four are moſt proper for the
Trade of the Company, who fell in the Iſland great Quantities of Salt, and
all Sorts of Linnen.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Java</hi> is an Iſland governed in like Manner by ſeveral
Kings, the King of <hi>Mataria,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe called Emperor of
<hi>Java,</hi> and the King of <hi>Bantam</hi> are the moſt conſiderable:
But the <hi>Dutch</hi> Power is ſo great by reaſon of <hi>Batavia</hi> and
other Fortreſſes, that I believe it may with very good reaſon be ſaid,
they are as much Maſters of that Iſland as they are of its Trade, which is
entirely in their Hands ſince they have <pb n="149" facs="tcp:56197:84"/>had
<hi>Bantam;</hi> It is certain the Company would make vaſt Advantage by
ſelling Linnen and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Commodities if this Trade was not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
diverted by other Nations trading hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo that the vent of this ſort of
Goods was conſiderably diminiſhed in the Year 1688: They bring chiefly
Pepper from the Iſle of <hi>Java</hi> and <hi>Bantam,</hi> and before the
<hi>Dutch</hi> were Maſters of theſe Places, the Merchants of
<hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> uſed to reſort hither to take in their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
            <p>The Iſle of <hi>Borneo</hi> is without diſpute, the largeſt in
the <hi>Indies,</hi> the Inhabitants the moſt perfidious and treacherous of
all the <hi>Indians,</hi> have more than once rob'd the Magazine of the
Company, and cut in peices all thoſe that were in it, the better to pillage
them: The treachery of thoſe People which is natural to them, is the reaſon
that the Company gives them leave to bring their Diamonds and Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire to
<hi>Batavia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Iſland of <hi>Macaſſar</hi> is divided amongſt ſeveral
petty Kings, of whom the King of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſar</hi> is the moſt powerful,
and one of the moſt dangerous Enemies the Company has in the <hi>Indies;</hi>
this Iſland produces great quantities of Rice, Pepper, Sandal, and
<hi>Siampan</hi> Wood. It is ſaid that there is likewiſe Store of Gold
duſt and Tortoize-ſhell, Commodities that go off well in the great
<hi>Mogul</hi>'s Country and in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> the Company maintains a
conſiderable <pb n="150" facs="tcp:56197:85"/>Garriſon in the Fort of
<hi>Macaſſar</hi> which is a Haven of extream conſequence for the Spice
Trade.</p>
            <p>The Iſland of <hi>Amboina</hi> and many others of great Reſort,
as <hi>Banda, Ternate, &amp;c.</hi> are poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed (to uſe the
Expreſſion) in propriety by the Company, which makes them Maſters of the
rich Commodities of Cloves, Nutmegs, and Mace, which grow no where elſe.</p>
            <p>The Iſland of <hi>Amboina</hi> yields only Cloves, which is a
Commodity that ſells well all the World over; it is but not the Iſles of
<hi>Ternate, Bachiam,</hi> and <hi>Machiam &amp;c.</hi> which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
ſpeaking the <hi>Molucca</hi> Iſlands produce this Spice as well as
<hi>Amboina,</hi> but the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny made the Trees every Year to be rooted up
reſerving only thoſe in <hi>Amboina,</hi> which Iſland alone is
ſufficient to produce more than the whole World can conſume: The People of
this Iſland ſell every Year to the Company or their Officers, their Cloves
at a low Price; and they are obliged to take all the Crop if I may uſe the
Word, how great ſoever it be; whence it often appears that their Stock is
greater than they can poſſibly diſpoſe of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Batavia</hi> always ſupplies the Inhabitants of this Place
with Proviſions for their Subſiſtance, for they are very lazy, and 'tis
impoſſible other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to make them work in their Spiceries; the Trade
here conſiſting only in Linnen and Cloths, is very inconſiderable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:56197:85"/>The Iſle of <hi>Banda</hi> is the only Place
that produces Nutmegs and Mace, the Company are entirely Maſters of the Trade
of this Iſland, excluſive of all other Nations as well as that of
<hi>Amboina;</hi> the Company vend here very few Commodities, except a ſmall
Quantity of Stuffs and ſuch like Goods; the Country being ſmall and ill
Peopled, which makes the Company ſend hither likewiſe Proviſions from
<hi>Batavia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Molucca</hi> Iſlands are Five in Number, and are called
<hi>Ternate, Tidor, Machiam, Bachiam,</hi> and <hi>Motire;</hi> they are
ſituated on the Weſt of the Iſle of <hi>Gillo,</hi> moſt of theſe
Iſlands are no more than Eight or Ten Leagues in compaſs, they are all of
them very agreeable and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, and tho' they have their Kings, yet the
<hi>Dutch</hi> in reality may be ſaid to be their Maſters and Sovereigns;
by reaſon of the Forts they have there. Theſe Iſlands were heretofore
ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry famous and much frequented, on account of the Cloves they produced in
ſuch vaſt Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities before the <hi>Dutch</hi> caus'd all the Trees to be
plucked up.</p>
            <p>The Iſland of <hi>Ternate</hi> is the moſt conſiderable, there
is a great Conſumption tn that Place of coarſe Linnen; the <hi>Dutch</hi>
bring thence Tortoiſe ſhell which is very good, but there is but a ſmall
Quantity: The Company pays yearly Penſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the King and other Lords of
<hi>Ternate,</hi> as an Acknowledgment for their conſenting to the
Deſtruction of the Clove Trees.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:56197:86"/>There are ſome other Iſlands in this
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, as <hi>Bantam, Tidor, &amp;c.</hi> but they are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ill cultivated
and produces little neceſſaries of Life: The Company trades thither as well
as to thoſe juſt now mentioned, in Linnen, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, and Pieces of
Eight from <hi>Mexico.</hi>

            </list>
            <p>I comprehend under the name of Spices, Cloves, Nutmegs and
Cinnamon.</p>
            <p>There are Two Sorts of Cinnamon, the fine, and common or mild
Cinnamon; the fine grows only in the Iſle of <hi>Ceylan,</hi> in a ſmall
tract of Ground of about Fourteen or Fifteen <pb n="153" facs="tcp:56197:86"/>Leagues long
on the Sea ſide, but in reality that Spot of Ground is ſo very fruitful,
that it is ſufficient to furniſh the whole World, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the little
Conſumption there is of this Spice at preſent.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> who are entirely Maſters of all the Sea-coaſt
of <hi>Ceylan,</hi> hinder the Multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of theſe fine Cinnamon Trees,
on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to keep up he Price of that rich Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity; they tell you that
they ſhould not ſell greater Quantities were it cheaper: it would be a very
difficult Matter to perſwade them to let any One ſhare this Commerce with
them, and even in that Caſe it would be very chargeable and expenſive.</p>
            <p>There is no young Lover ſo jealous of his Miſtreſs as the
<hi>Dutch</hi> are of their Spice Trade.</p>
            <p>Their Fleet that returned in the Year 1687, brought into
<hi>Holland</hi> 170000 weight of Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namon, which was but a ſmall Quantity
in Compariſon to what they brought the Year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> omit no pains to deſtroy the Trees. They ſay
that the chief Motives they had in poſſeſſing themſelves of
<hi>Cochim,</hi> was on account of the Damage they received by the
<hi>Portugueze</hi> ſelling the wild Cinnamon for that of <hi>Ceylan,</hi>
which hindred the Company from ſetting what Price they pleaſed on theirs;
and ſelling what Quantities they otherwiſe might.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:56197:87"/>Though the <hi>Molucca</hi> Iſlands and
<hi>Amboina</hi> the chief Places where Cloves grow, are of no very large
extent, yet <hi>Amboina</hi> only produces all the Cloves that are uſed in
all Parts of the World; for the <hi>Dutch</hi> who are Maſters of theſe
Iſlands by eans of their Fortreſſes, have cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all the Trees to be
rooted up as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, except thoſe of <hi>Amboina:</hi> And to make
the King of <hi>Ternate</hi> Satisfaction for that Loſs, the Company allows
every Year 12000 Crowns Penſion, and about 6000 in Preſents.</p>
            <p>But then the Company is obliged to take all that the
<hi>Amboiners</hi> bring them, for which they are to allow them 8.
<hi>
                  <abbr>d.</abbr>
               </hi> a Pound.</p>
            <p>Nutmegs and Mace grow only in the Iſle of <hi>Banda,</hi> of which
the <hi>Dutch</hi> are likewiſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and they take great care to
hinder the increaſe of theſe Trees, and have uſed the ſame precautions
to ſecure to themſelves this rich Commerce, as well as that of Cinnamon and
Cloves.</p>
            <p>They were not Maſters of the Cloves and Nutmegs, till they had
conquered the King of <hi>Macaſſar,</hi> and to rid themſelves of all
Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions for the future, they obliged him to drive all the
<hi>Portugueze</hi> out of his Country, and ſhut out of his Sea-ports all
Ships that ſhould come from <hi>Europe</hi> except thoſe belonging to the
<hi>Dutch</hi> Company, which has effectually made them abſolute Maſters of
that rich Trade: For the People of the Iſle of <hi>Macaſſar</hi> being
near <pb n="155" facs="tcp:56197:87"/>Neighbours to thoſe of the <hi>Molucca</hi>
Iſlands u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to take under Hand vaſt Quantities of Cloves and Nutmegs,
and ſell them to the <hi>Portugueze</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> at a lower
Price than the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which di not a little prejudice their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce.</p>
            <p>In ſhort the <hi>Dutch</hi> have ſpared no Pains to ſecure (to
themſelves only) the Spice Trade; Spices being Commodities much eſteemed
and ſought after all over the World and wholly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed by the
<hi>Dutch,</hi> have put them in a Condition to diſpoſe of all other
Commodities in the Univerſe: In a Word the Spices are the Baſis of their
great Commerce, and go as ready Money in a great many Countries.</p>
            <p>How great ſoever the Quantities of Cloves brought into
<hi>Europe</hi> may be, they ſell yet much more in the <hi>Indies,</hi> where
the Company have fixed the Price of Cloves to 75 Stivers a Pound, and Nutmegs
after the rate of 60 Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers when they give them in' Payment.</p>
            <p>An <hi>Engliſh</hi> Memorial made in the Year 1663 ſays that the
<hi>Dutch</hi> with the Spices that they ſell in the Great-<hi>Mogul</hi>'s
Country, <hi>Perſia, Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi> and <hi>Coromandel,</hi> and all along the
Coaſts of the Red-Sea both in <hi>Arabia</hi> and <hi>Egypt &amp;c.</hi> buy
the Proviſions and other Commodities of theſe vaſt Kingdoms, proper for
<hi>Europe</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Parts of the World.</p>
            <p>To the Spices I may add, Pepper and Ginger.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:56197:88"/>Pepper grows chiefly on the Coaſt of
<hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labar,</hi> and in the Iſland of <hi>Sumatra</hi> and <hi>Java,</hi>
of which there are two ſorts, the large and ſmall; moſt part of the large
ſort comes from <hi>Malabar,</hi> and is what generally is ſent into
<hi>Europe;</hi> the ſmall comes from <hi>Bantam, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem,</hi> &amp;c. very
little of this ſort comes to us, for the <hi>Mahometans</hi> conſume
almoſt all of it.</p>
            <p>Pepper is a Commodity that abounds very much in thoſe Parts, and
coſts the <hi>Dutch</hi> but little in the <hi>Indies:</hi> It ſells ſo
well in <hi>Perſia, Arabia, China,</hi> and <hi>Japan;</hi> that thoſe
Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires produce nothing but what may be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by Pepper, which is the
only Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity that goes as ready Money, and by which they get <hi>Cent per
Cent</hi> at leaſt.</p>
            <p>It is very true that there is greater Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Pepper in
the <hi>Indies</hi> than in <hi>Europe,</hi> and I have been aſſured by
Perſons of good Credit and Capacity, that it is more wholſome in thoſe
hot Countries than in cold and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Climates.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> put it whole into their Diſhes or at moſt
but bruiſed and never ground as we do, and ſo do the
<hi>Mahometans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> have often complained (and not without
Reaſon) that the <hi>Dutch</hi> do all they can to make themſelves
Maſters of the Pepper as they now are of the Spice Trade, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly 
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:56197:88"/>in the Parliament which was held in the Year 1669, after
this Manner, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>We are very well aſſured that the <hi>Dutch</hi> have long
ſince had a Deſign to force the Princes and Governours along the Coaſts
of <hi>Malabar, Achem,</hi> the Weſtern Coaſt of <hi>Suma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra</hi> and
<hi>Java &amp;c.</hi> and thoſe Princes and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours have often reported,
that they have force them not only to enter into Treaties with them in Relation
to their Pepper and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Commodities of the growth of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, but in
their Treaties of Peace, have ty'd them up to hinder all other Nations from
trad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them; and have actually made War againſt thoſe who would not
accept of ſuch Conditions, they have even block'd up their Ports and forbid
Entrance to other People: And by theſe Means, have taken from them all
liberty of Trade, till ſuch Times as they have made them comply with their
Demands, which practices tend to the Ruin of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Trade in
the <hi>Eaſt-Indies.</hi>

            <p>Ginger is the Root of a Tree ſomewhat like a Roſe-Tree, growing
about <hi>Malabar,</hi> a Town in the Great-<hi>Mogul</hi>'s Country, and which
yields the greateſt Quantities; and ſupplies all foreign Parts. The
<hi>Indians, Engliſh, Dutch,</hi> and all the People of the North, uſe a
great deal of candied Ginger to warm the Stomach and help Digeſtion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:56197:89"/>Amongſt the Drugs I may reckon Indigo,
Saltpetre, Sugar, Lacca, Ambergreece, Musk, Tea, Rhubarb, Borax, Benzoin,
Bezoar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indigo is made of an Herb much reſembling our Hemp, they rot the
leaves in little Ponds made for that Purpoſe which reduce them to a Kind of
Clay, and then a little afterwards it becomes Indigo; all that which comes from
the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> (for there is ſome that comes likewiſe from the
<hi>Weſt-Indies</hi>) is made only in the <hi>Mogul</hi>'s Country, except a
ſmall Quantity that comes from the Kingdom of <hi>Golconda,</hi> that which
is made in the Province of <hi>Agra</hi> is eſteemed the beſt.</p>
            <p>It is believed the <hi>Dutch</hi> every Year bring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Europe,</hi> 50 or 60 Thouſand Weight of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digo from <hi>Agra,</hi> good
part of which is ſent into <hi>Germany,</hi> and <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> where
they uſe it as as they do in other Countrys, for dying Blue.</p>
            <p>Saltpetre as well as Indigo comes from the <hi>Mogul</hi>'s Country
<hi>Agra,</hi> and <hi>Pattua,</hi> two Towns in the Kingdom of
<hi>Bengal,</hi> yield the moſt: This is a very conſiderable Article in the
<hi>Dutch</hi> Trade, and from thence they bring vaſt Quantities and as good
as any in the World. The laſt Fleet that came from the <hi>Indies</hi> on the
Companies Account, brought 28170 Quintals which was all conſumed in
<hi>Holland</hi> in making Gun-powder for the Republick.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:56197:89"/>There is alſo in the ſaid Kingdom of
<hi>Bengal</hi> much coarſe Sugar, which the <hi>Dutch</hi> buy in great
Quantities to refine in <hi>Holland</hi> and ſell afterwards with great
Profit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lacca</hi> is particularly to be had in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of
<hi>Pegu,</hi> and <hi>Azen,</hi> and in the Province of <hi>Bengal</hi> and
<hi>Guzoratte:</hi> It is a Kind of Gum which exquiſite Production is made by
a Sort of <hi>Indian</hi> Ant or Piſmire, much after the ſame Manner as the
Bees make their Honey.</p>
            <p>There is red Lacca and black, but there is nothing the Quantity of
the black as the red Sort; out of the red, the <hi>Indians</hi> have the Secret
to extract that beautiful Scarlet Colour with which they dye their Silks and
Callicoes, and they make it ſerve for any other Colour they pleaſe; they
alſo uſe it to lacquer their fine Cabinets and other <hi>Indian</hi> Works,
and to make a Kind of Sealing-Wax. 'Tis a good Commodity for the
<hi>Dutch,</hi> for it coſts in <hi>India</hi> generally Ten Stivers a Pound,
and they ſell it to us at Ten Stivers an Ounce after they have mix'd with it
half the Quantity of Rozin, which makes their Gain exorbitant.</p>
            <p>Rhubarb is the Root of a Plant of great ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in Phyſick, it
grows in great Quantities in <hi>Tartary,</hi> and particularly in the Kingdom
of <hi>Bouton,</hi> as well as in <hi>China;</hi> however the moſt
underſtanding Traders agree, that which grows in the Kingdom of
<hi>Bouton</hi> is the beſt: I have <pb n="160" facs="tcp:56197:90"/>ſaid ſomething
of this in the Chapter of the <hi>Levant</hi> Trade.</p>
            <p>The fineſt Musk comes alſo from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Bouton,</hi>
and there is no Country in <hi>Aſia</hi> where there are ſo many of thoſe
Animals that produce it as in that Kingdom, which is ſituated between the
Great-<hi>Mogul</hi>'s Country and <hi>Tartary,</hi> and little known to the
People of <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Merchants of <hi>Aſia</hi> go into this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to buy this
Commodity, there comes a great deal by the Way of <hi>Pattua</hi> a Town in the
Kingdom of <hi>Bengal,</hi> where the People of the Country, and the
<hi>Dutch,</hi> and <hi>Portugueze</hi> generally buy it; there is a far
greater Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of it in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and eſpecially in
<hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, Turky, &amp;c.</hi> than in <hi>Europe;</hi> it grows in a
little Bladder of the bigneſs of a ſmall Hen's Egg, between the Navel and
the Privities of thoſe Animals that produce this precious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity.</p>
            <p>Amber-greece is only to be had in the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern Countries of
<hi>Africa,</hi> but chiefly on the Coaſt of <hi>Melinda</hi> near the Mouth
of <hi>Rioſena,</hi> the <hi>Portugueze</hi> Governours of
<hi>Mozambique,</hi> lay up great Quantities which they carry with them into
<hi>Europe</hi> and ſell for vaſt Sums.</p>
            <p>Tea grows in ſome Provinces of <hi>China,</hi> and is nothing but
the leaves of a Tree that grows about Twelve or Fourteen Foot High, and which
they gather in the Spring Time, taking <pb n="161" facs="tcp:56197:90"/>only the Leaves
about the Branches; as ſoon as theſe Leaves are gathered, they dry them in
Copper Pans over the Fire, continually ſhak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them till they are dry; after
that they put them in Leaden Boxes. There is a great Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity grows in
<hi>Japan,</hi> and the <hi>Dutch</hi> furniſh themſelves thence with this
Commodity as well as from <hi>Cochin-China,</hi> the <hi>Japan</hi> Tea is
better than that of <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Cochin-China;</hi> the beſt
<hi>China</hi> Tea coſts at <hi>Surat</hi> but twenty pence a pound, which
the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſell in <hi>Europe</hi> for twenty Crowns, and the worſt
Sort for 25 and 30 Livres.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> have been often accuſed of mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Tea
they bring into <hi>Europe,</hi> the Leaves of young Sage which has a ſtrong
Taſte and brisk Flavour, and when dryed in an Oven is not unlike Tea; but
People may very eaſily be impoſed on, and I am pretty well aſſured that
they bring a great deal of Sage pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared after this Manner into
<hi>China,</hi> where they ſell it very dear.</p>
            <p>I ſhall purpoſely omit what may be ſaid of Borax, Camphire,
Benzoin, and Bezoar; that I may come to the Raw and Woven Silks, ſince
theſe Commodities make One of the greateſt Articles in their
<hi>Indian</hi> Trade: They have their Silk chiefly from <hi>China,</hi> the
Kingdoms of <hi>Tonquin, Tripara, Azem, Bengal,</hi> and <hi>Perſia;</hi> the
Silks are of ſeveral Sorts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:56197:91"/>That of <hi>China</hi> is the fineſt and
whiteſt; that of <hi>Tonquin</hi> is alſo very good and ſoft; People are
of Opinion that theſe of <hi>Tripara</hi> and <hi>Azem</hi> are much
coarſer; the <hi>Bengal</hi> Silks are rough and without any gloſs or
luſtre, for which Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon there is not much Conſumption made of them but
in the Manufactures of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh:</hi> That of
<hi>Perſia,</hi> which is full and large, is only good to make coarſe Laces
and Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loons, Silk Thread and Twiſt, and there is ſcarce Twenty Pound in
any Bale whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
            <p>There is a Sort of Silk in <hi>China,</hi> and in the Kingdom of
<hi>Azem,</hi> which is ſpun upon Trees and Buſhes by a Kind of Animal like
a Caterpiller, but not round as that of the Silk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worm, but in a flat thread of
a vaſt length, which, by the blowing of the Wind, fixes it ſelf to Shrubs
and Buſhes: Of this Silk they make Stuffs ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what coarſer than what are
made of the other Sort, though much ſtronger.</p>
            <p>They weave Silks of all ſorts in ſeveral Countries and Provinces
of <hi>Aſia</hi> where raw Silk is produced, except in the Kingdom of
<hi>Txipara,</hi> which fends its raw Silks to <hi>China.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this Empire produces a prodigious Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity (for l've been
aſſured that the Province of <hi>Chang</hi> produces as much as all the
World beſides) they weave Silks here in ſuch great Quantities, as is
almoſt incredible</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:56197:91"/>They make Silk Stuffs, Cloth of Gold and
Silver, Sattins of all ſorts of Colours, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masks and other Silks which they
call in <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> Pelings, Gentings, and Panfiens.</p>
            <p>They make theſe Stuffs for the moſt Part in the Province of
<hi>Canton,</hi> where they are ſold at a moderate Price; One may get
<hi>Cent per Cent</hi> to ſell them again if bought at the Firſt Hand.</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſay nothing of their Beauty and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for they
are well known to all <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Chineſe</hi> (if One may credit their Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians) have
made Silk Two Thouſand and Fourſcore Years before the Birth of Chriſt,
however it is certain other Nations knew it long after the <hi>Chineſe,</hi>
and it was by their Means that this Manufacture went from <hi>China,</hi> into
the <hi>Indies</hi> and <hi>Perſia.</hi> Two Monks who had travelled into
that Country, at their Return to <hi>Italy,</hi> taught Firſt the
<hi>Romans</hi> in the Time of the Emperor <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> the Manner of
feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and bringing up of Silkworms, and ſince that Time the
<hi>Italians</hi> who traded to the Eaſt, brought this Secret into
<hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Great <hi>Mogul</hi>'s Country, they make likewiſe a great
many Sorts of rich Stuſſs of Silk, ſome all Silk, ſome with Gold and
Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver as they do in <hi>Perſia.</hi> But enough of this Subject: I come now
to ſpeak of</p>
            <p>Cotton and Callicoes, which are a great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle in the <hi>Dutch
Eaſt India</hi> Trade. <pb n="164" facs="tcp:56197:92"/>Cotton grows in great abundance
in the Great <hi>Mogul</hi>'s Country, on the Coaſts of <hi>Coroman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del,
Bengal, and China;</hi> they make in all theſe Countries a prodigious
Quantity of all Sorts of Callicoes, but chiefly in the Empire of the
Great-<hi>Mogul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Callicoes are both White and colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the White are generally
the fineſt, and have commonly a ſtripe of Gold or Silver run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all along
the Piece, and many have thoſe ſtripes at each End; ſometimes they are
em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered with Flowers. Theſe Callicoes are very dear and bought by
Perſons of Deſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for Scarves, Quilts, and Veils, Handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, and
Cravats; they ſell great Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in <hi>Perſia</hi> and <hi>Turky.</hi>
There are ſome Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licoes wonderfully White and ſo very finely wrought,
that One can ſcarce ſee the Threads, and theſe are generally kept for the
Uſe of the Women in the Great-<hi>Mogul</hi>'s Seraglio.</p>
            <p>The fine Muſlins come from the Kingdom of <hi>Bengal</hi> where
they are made, the coloured Callicoes are called Chintz or Chittes, ſome of
which are printed with a Mould, others painted with a Pencil; and in reality,
the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of the Deſign amd the fine colourings of theſe Cloaths are
wonderful.</p>
            <p>Theſe that are painted the fineſt, are made in the Kingdom of
<hi>Golconda</hi> and in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try about <hi>Mazulipatam,</hi> that Sort
which they call Basfas are only Dyed with one Colour <pb n="165" facs="tcp:56197:92"/>as
Red or Black, of which as well as the White there is a great Conſumption on
the Coaſt of <hi>Melinda,</hi> and in the Emperor of the
<hi>Abyſſin</hi>'s Country; the <hi>Philippine</hi> Iſlands of
<hi>Borneo, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matra</hi> and <hi>Java, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next to the Spices, the Callicoes and other Cotton Stuffs make one
of the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Articles in the <hi>Dutch Eaſt-India</hi>
Trade; for beſides thoſe ſurpriſing Quantities they bring into
<hi>Europe,</hi> which may be ſeen by the Catalogues or Liſts oſ their
Cargoes, the Company ſells no leſs in the ſeveral Countries of
<hi>Aſia</hi> where they Trade to.</p>
            <p>I take no Notice of Cotton Thread brought into <hi>Europe,</hi>
Cloth made of the Bark of Trees, <hi>Perſian</hi> Wooll, and the fine Woollen
Carpets made at <hi>Agra.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tho' the People of <hi>Europe</hi> who trade to the <hi>Indies</hi>
bring back neither Gold nor Silver, but on the contrary carry both into theſe
Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, I ſhall in few Words give an Account of the Places where theſe
valuable Mettals are to be had, and which are ſo very neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the
<hi>Dutch</hi> Company to make their Trade flouriſh in the
<hi>Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a great Quantity of Gold in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Places of
<hi>Aſia,</hi> eſpecially in <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan;</hi> in the
Kingdoms of <hi>Pegu, Siam, Azem, Tripara,</hi> and <hi>Camboya,</hi> and in
the Iſlands of <hi>Sumatra</hi> and <hi>Macaſſar:</hi> But <hi>China</hi>
is the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of all <hi>Aſia</hi> where it moſt abounds, not but 
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:56197:93"/>that they have very rich Mines of Gold in <hi>Japan,</hi>
but there is none ever ſuffered to come out; the Emperor having prohibited it
under ſevere Penalties, and his Commands are rigour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly obſerved.</p>
            <p>As the <hi>Chineſe</hi> are very fond of Silver, and have very
little of it, they make no Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to give their Gold for Silver; and there
is vaſt Profit to be made by thoſe who know how to manage this
Exchange.</p>
            <p>They omit no Pains to get the Piaſtres or Pieces of Eight of
<hi>Mexico,</hi> and they get good Quantities by the People of the
<hi>Philippine</hi> Iſlands, who Trade to <hi>Mexico.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Silver Mines are nothing near ſo numerous in <hi>Aſia</hi> as
thoſe of Gold, and indeed there ſeems to be but very little Silver there;
ſince there is ſcarce any Prince from the Great-<hi>Mogul</hi>'s Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
to <hi>Japan</hi> that coins any Money: In Truth the riches of the Mines in the
<hi>Mogul</hi>'s Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try are ſo great, that they pay for all Goods brought
thither in Gold as they do in <hi>China;</hi> and as the <hi>Dutch</hi> are the
only Nation in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> that Trade to <hi>Japan,</hi> and their Trade
to that Country is very conſiderable; ſo they bring thence a great deal of
Silver which generally is in Pieces of the Value of our Crowns, they carry
almoſt all that Money into the Great <hi>Mogul</hi>'s Country, where
<hi>Commiſſioners of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi> give them 3 <hi>per Cent</hi> more than
they will for our Crowns.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:56197:93"/>The <hi>Dutch</hi> bring from <hi>Japan,</hi> a
ſort of Red Copper which is excellent and much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than moſt of what is
in <hi>Europe,</hi> being ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more malleable and pliant, which makes
it 25 <hi>per Cent</hi> dearer: The Company carry much of it to the Coaſts of
<hi>Coromandel</hi> and <hi>Bengal,</hi> and diſpoſe of it to great
Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; that which they bring into <hi>Europe,</hi> is ſent to <hi>Aix la
Chappel</hi> to be workt up there in ſmall and large Veſſels, Copper
Furnaces, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and good Quantities of it is employed in the
Foundery for Cannons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> their <hi>Indian</hi> Fleet in the Year
1694, brought 27650 Pound Weight, and thoſe that have come ſince, have
brought Six Times as much.</p>
            <p>Tin and Lead abound very much in the Kingdom of <hi>Siam,</hi> and
towards <hi>Malacca;</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> have the Privilege to buy thoſe
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities at <hi>Ligor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Tin Trade is very profitable to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and they buy
it with <hi>Bengal</hi> Carpets and <hi>Coromandel</hi> Linnen, which they
purchaſe very cheap. Tin ſells very well in other Sea Ports in the
<hi>Mogul</hi>'s Country, and in <hi>Perſia,</hi> and <hi>Arabia:</hi> The
<hi>Dutch</hi> have often brought into <hi>Europe</hi> very great Quantities of
Tin, their Fleet in the Year 1694, brought about 28845 Pound Weight, and what
they have brought ſince, is Five or Six Times as much, which they ſell with
vaſt Profit, though it is very fine and they ſell it cheap.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:56197:94"/>What remains now, is that I ſpeak a few Words
about Pearls and precious Stones, Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celain or <hi>China</hi> Ware.</p>
            <p>The Diamond is no where to be found but in Four Countries of

            <p>That of <hi>Viſapore</hi> was only known about 200 Years ago.</p>
            <p>The Mine of <hi>Golconda</hi> which is Seven Days Journey from the
Capital of that Name, has been known no more than 120 Years, yet I have been
inform'd that it is the richeſt and moſt frequented of any, it employing
conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly above 60000 People.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Portugueze</hi> are ſuppoſed to bring into
<hi>Europe</hi> the moſt Diamonds of any People; perhaps on Account of their
Trade which to this Day is ſtill carried on in <hi>Goa</hi> the chief Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the <hi>Indies</hi> for Traffick, eſpecially for O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riental Pearls.</p>
            <p>The other precious Stones of ſeveral fine Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours come likewiſe

            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> Company beſides theſe Pearls juſt now
ſpoken of, ſend into <hi>Furope,</hi> another ſort of Pearl which they
ſell by the Ounce, and for which they have a conſiderable vent.</p>
            <p>Porcelain, or what we call China ware, is only made in
<hi>China</hi> and <hi>Japan;</hi> but that of <hi>China</hi> is much more
valuable.</p>
            <p>The Earth they make this laſt ſort of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na is only found and
prepared near the Town <hi>Ojenchen</hi> in the Province of <hi>Viangly,</hi>
and where only they make it; for the Waters of no other Place can give ſuch
beautiful Luſtre to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, or make the Work tranſparent: There are
ſeveral ſorts of China or Porcelain, ſome have a White Ground, ſome
Yellow, Red, and Blue; the <hi>Chineſe</hi> carry a great Deal of this 
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:56197:95"/>Ware to <hi>Batavia</hi> and other Places, and diſpoſe
of great Quantities.</p>
            <p>There are alſo great Quantities of China or Porcelain as well as
other Goods, brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Europe</hi> from the <hi>Indies</hi> by the
Fleet from <hi>Mexico</hi> or <hi>New Spain,</hi> and which come thither in the
Ships belonging to the <hi>Philippine</hi> Iſlands.</p>
            <p>One may reckon among Porcelain or China Ware, thoſe earthen Pots
the <hi>Chineſe</hi> make their Tea in, and of which they bring great
Quantities into <hi>Europe;</hi> they make theſe Pots at <hi>Kiantz</hi> and
<hi>Guihinig,</hi> thoſe that are made in this latter Place are eſteemed
the moſt (tho' not ſo beautiful as the others,) becauſe they give a fine
Taſte and Flavour to the Liquor, which the <hi>Chineſe</hi> admire.</p>
            <p>They bring alſo from <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Japan,</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binets,
Boxes, Fans, Trunks, and ſeveral other Things of that Nature, of admirable
Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip and delicately varniſhed.</p>
            <p>I come now to conclude theſe Remarks, and ſhall only add in
ſhort that of the ſeveral Sorts of Wood that the Company cauſes to be
brought from the <hi>Indies,</hi> either for Joyners Work, Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, or
Dying; the principal are Aquila Wood, Siampan, (which is the ſame as Brazil)
Lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Aloes, Sindal, and Roſe Wood, Ebony, Calambour, Catatour, and Cocoa;
moſt of which ſell very well even in the <hi>Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All theſe ſorts of Goods are brought into <hi>Europe</hi> by
Ships belonging to the Company, <pb n="172" facs="tcp:56197:96"/>which Sail generally from
<hi>Batavia</hi> and the Iſle of <hi>Ceylan,</hi> which are likewiſe the
Places of Rendezvouz for thoſe that come from <hi>Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandel</hi> and
<hi>Bengal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the general Rendezvouz of all Shipping that come from the
<hi>Indies</hi> into <hi>Europe,</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt always at the <hi>Cape of
Good-Hope,</hi> whence afterwards they Sail altogether for <hi>Europe;</hi>
ſometimes indeed it ſo falls out, that the Firſt Squadron does not ſtay
for the Second, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if they have waited long for their arrival.</p>
            <p>They Sail generally from the <hi>Indies</hi> in the Month of
<hi>December</hi> and <hi>January,</hi> and come into <hi>Holland</hi> towards
<hi>July</hi> and <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and ſometimes later.</p>
            <p>The Directors of the <hi>India</hi> Company make Sale of their Goods
in <hi>Holland</hi> twice a Year. When the Company has reſolved upon a Sale,
they ſend printed circular Letters to every Town of the united Provinces, in
which are inſerted the Names and Quantities of ſuch Goods they Deſign to
make Sale of and the Time and Place, when and where ſuch Sale is to be made:
One Half is generally ſold in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> the
Fourth Part at <hi>Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg,</hi> and a Sixth in the ſeveral Chambers of
<hi>Delft, Rotterdam, Horn,</hi> and <hi>Enchuyſen;</hi> and theſe Goods
are ſold to the higheſt Bidder.</p>
            <p>The Ships that bring into <hi>Europe</hi> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns from the
<hi>Indies,</hi> bring likewiſe the Books and Memoirs concerning the Trade of
the <pb n="173" facs="tcp:56197:96"/>Company, with a general Ballance of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,
Disburſments and Loſſes they have had in their <hi>India</hi> Trade.</p>
            <p>The Company cauſes alſo in <hi>Holland</hi> a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Account
to be made in the Month of <hi>May,</hi> Copies of which they cauſe to be

which Four laſt Chambers altogether have only One Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or Fourth
Share.</item>
            </list>
            <p>In the Chamber of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> there are 24 Directors, of
whom Twenty are Citizens and Magiſtrates, except Five or Six Merchants, who
govern almoſt all what concerns Sales and Purchaſes, for the Company, and

by the Towns of <hi>Tergou, Utrecht, Dort,</hi> and <hi>Leyden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Chamber of <hi>Middlebourg,</hi> has Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Directors who

            <p>To be Director, a Man muſt neceſſarily have Two Shares in the

            <p>The general Aſſembly or Court of Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen is held only twice

            <p>In a Word the Aſſembly of Seventeen, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides generally all the
Affairs of Conſequence relating to the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company.</p>
            <p>This famous Company governs all the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories the <hi>Dutch</hi>
poſſeſs in the <hi>Indies</hi> which are very conſiderable, as alſo
all Commerce which is managed by a Council of State arbitrarily cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen and
whoſe Reſidence is in <hi>Batavia.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>This Council is compoſed of a Governour General who is their
Preſident, and has Two Voices.</item>
               <item> A Director General.</item>
               <item> Six ordinary Counſellors of State.</item>
               <item> And as many extraordinary as the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhall think
fit.</item>
               <item> The Governour is alſo their Generaliſſimo in all
Military Affairs on the other Side of the <hi>Cape of Good Hope.</hi>
               </item>
               <item> He has under him a Major General.</item>
               <item> Particular Admirals</item>
               <item> 
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:56197:98"/> And the Admirals of each
Squadron.</item>
            </list>
            <p>The Office of Governour General is only to give Orders, and is
accountable to none, they chuſe him every Three Years, but commonly he is
continued on as long as he lives; for 'twould coſt the Company too much to
have a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour General get an Eſtate under them every Three Years.</p>
            <p>The Company allows him every Month 800 Crowns Penſion, and 500
Crowns more for his Table, beſides the Entertainment of all his Family, which
is a very conſiderable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence.</p>
            <p>He has a Key to every Magazine and can take out what he will,
without giving an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to any One.</p>
            <p>It may be ſaid his Authority in ſome ſort would equal that of
the late Princes of <hi>Orange,</hi> was it not in the Company's Power to
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke it when they pleaſed; for in Effect he is <hi>Stadtholder, Captain
General,</hi> and <hi>High Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral</hi> of the <hi>Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Court is more Pompous, his Train more Magnificent than was that
of thoſe Princes, and ſurpaſſes even ſome Kings in <hi>Europe.</hi>
When he goes out 50 Horſe Guards go before his Coach, which is followed by a
fine Company of Foot, 12 Pages walk of each ſide of his Coach and all very
richly and Magnificently dreſt. When he gives Audience to the Ambaſſadors
of the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> 
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:56197:98"/>Kings, 'tis with extraordinary
Pomp and Splendour.</p>
            <p>All which ſerves very much to gain Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and Reſpect from
the People of <hi>Aſia</hi> who are mightily taken with outward ſhow and
finery. In a Word there are few Kings in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> who make ſo
ſplendid a Figure and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance as his Governour General, eſpecially if
he be a Man of good Senſe, for then it is in his Power to govern the Council
as he pleaſes: The World has ſeen an Example of this in the Perſon of
Monſieur <hi>Speelman;</hi> who did every Thing after his own Way, made War
and Peace when he pleaſed, and the Company's Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral that ſtood in awe of
him approved of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Thing he did.</p>
            <p>The Director General who is the ſecond Perſon of the Council of
State in the <hi>Indies,</hi> has every Thing in his Hands, and is anſwerable
accordingly.</p>
            <p>The Votes of the extraordinary Counſellours are not reckoned in
any Debate, when the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and the ſix ordinary Counſellours of State
are preſent.</p>
            <p>When a Counſellor dies or any other Member of the Aſſembly,
'tis in the Power of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellours to appoint his Succeſſor, who
muſt be confirmed by the general Company; if I am not much miſtaken
Monſieur <hi>Champtiffe</hi> who ſucceeded Monſieur <hi>Speelman,</hi>
was choſen by the Council, and confirmed by the Company.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:56197:99"/>Beſides theſe, there are Two principal
Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants whoſe charge is to ſee the Ships lade and unlade; theſe are
very conſiderable Poſts, and are eſteemed the beſt, next being of the
Council.</p>
            <p>There are ſix Governours of Provinces, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <list>
                  <item>The Governour of <hi>Coromandel.</hi>
                  </item>

                  <item>The Governour of <hi>Banda.</hi>

                  <item>The Governour of <hi>Ternate.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>The Governour of the Iſle of <hi>Ceylan,</hi> and</item>
                  <item>The Governour of <hi>Malacca.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I have been aſſured that thoſe ſix Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours are all
Abſolute in their reſpective Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, and that they cannot be
diſplaced by the Council of <hi>Batavia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The particular Governours of all the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from the <hi>Cape of
Good Hope</hi> are called Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, I don't know if the Council of
<hi>Bata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi> has the Nomination of them, or the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of
<hi>Seventeen;</hi> however I am certain that the Aſſembly nominates the
Governour of the <hi>Cape of Good Hope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The General and his Council chooſes all the Commiſſioners,
Merchants and Subaltern Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; however, if any one is recommended by the
Sharers, they take care to provide for him very well.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:56197:99"/>Beſides the Council of State, at
<hi>Batavia,</hi> there is a Council of Juſtice who are Supreme Judges of all
Proceſs Civil and Criminal, and have even the Power to try the Governour
General, and condemn him to Death, if found guilty of Treaſon.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> Company, the better to carry on Trade in the
<hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> to ſecure the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and all Forts and Magazines or
Store-hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes they are in Poſſeſſion of in thoſe Places, maintain a
Hundred and Fourteen Veſſels, from Thirty to Sixty Pieces of Cannon, and
above Five and Twenty Thouſand Men, Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, Common Soldiers, and Seamen in
their Pay.</p>
            <p>The Company maintains in the <hi>Indies</hi> in all Twelve
Thouſand regular Troops, but in every Place where there is a <hi>Dutch</hi>
Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, there are always great Numbers of the Natives capable of bearing
Arms, which they always put in the Front when they go to Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.</p>
            <p>I have been informed that in theſe different Countries, the
Company have, beſides their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Troops, above a Hundred Thouſand Men
able to carry Arms.</p>
            <p>The Major General commands all the Troops under the Governour
General, he is the Second Perſon in the <hi>Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Company in Time of War augment their Forces both by Sea and
Land, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <pb n="180" facs="tcp:56197:100"/>their ordinary Veſſels, can
equip Fourty of the larger Sort; there are many Crowned Heads in
<hi>Europe</hi> who would find it very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to do as much.</p>
            <p>However all the great Power that this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Company has in the
<hi>Indies,</hi> is nothing but the Reſult of the Induſtry of a ſmall
Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Men, of about 60 Subſtantial and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Traders, firm
and conſtant in their Undertakings, and who want nothing of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo many
Sovereign Princes but their Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on the States General: In other
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects this Famous Company is looked upon as abſolute in
<hi>Holland,</hi> and in all other Places no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates all Magiſtrates,
Admirals, Generals, and all Governours; ſends and receives Ambaſſadors to
and from Kings and Sovereign Princes, makes Peace and War when ever it
pleaſes, and by its own Authority adminiſters Juſtice, inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
Officers to execute it abſolutely in its own Name; puniſhes and pardons
Crimes, gives Rewards and Preſents worthy the Grandeur and Magnificence of
Kings; eſtabliſhes Colonies, builds Forts, levies Troops, maintains Armies
and great Garriſons, fits out Fleets of Men of War, and coins Money.</p>
            <p>It is eaſy to diſcover by this Account, that the <hi>India</hi>
Trade muſt bring immenſe Treaſures to the Company; beſides the Dividend
the Company makes every Year to the Sharers, it ſupplies thoſe exorbitant
Expences which it is <pb n="181" facs="tcp:56197:100"/>obliged to make in the
<hi>Indies</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi> to pay all the Officers, Directors,
Commiſſioners, Soldiers and Seamen; in building Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, buying
Ammunition for all Places, and an infinity of other Expences, for Building,
Freighting and Victualling great Numbers of large and ſmall Ships, for the
Maintenance and Augmentation of its maritime Forces.</p>
            <p>The Gains of the Company, more than their Expences and
Disburſments, amount generally to three Millions of Gold every Year,
inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Returns, all Freight paid, which comes to 15 or 16 Millions of
Livres a Year, reckoning one with the other, amounting in the whole to 50
Millions of Livres.</p>
            <p>The immenſe Gains of this Company, ſince their
Eſtabliſhment, excited the <hi>French</hi> in 1664 to undertake this Trade;
but Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence has made them know, that what is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the
<hi>Dutch,</hi> is not always convenient for other People: In ſhort, this
Trade that has gain'd them ſuch vaſt Riches (being Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the
Spiceries) can never be of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to any Country or People, who muſt
em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy ready Money in purchaſing at very dear Rates, and at ſecond Hand,
ſuch Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by which they get Twenty for One, or elſe take from them
ſuch Goods as are deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to their own Manufactures.</p>
            <p>This has actually been the Caſe of <hi>France;</hi> for when the
King prohibited all painted <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> 
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:56197:101"/>Stuffs to be
worn in that Kingdom, they ſaw in a Moment their Manufactures of ſlight
Woollen Stuffs recover their Credit.</p>
            <p>The Gains of the Company would be much more conſiderable if they
were ſerved in the <hi>Indies</hi> with an exact Fidelity; the Company is
very well ſatisfied, and has no Reaſon to doubt, but that the greateſt
part of the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, of all Ranks, employed in that Service, and who have
large Penſions and are well paid, do not ſcruple to raiſe themſelves
great Fortunes at the Company's coſt: This is viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in thoſe who
return from the <hi>Indies,</hi> and who had any Management there, or
Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
            <p>But how great ſoever the Diſtance between <hi>Holland</hi> and
the <hi>Indies</hi> may be, yet is it not impoſſible to reform the
greateſt part of thoſe Abuſes the Officers commit in the <hi>Indies;</hi>
but moſt of them being Relations or Friends, and often Creatures of the
Directors, are generally incapable of the Employments they are put in, which is
the reaſon they are not over ſevere in paſſing their Account; nay,
ſome will have it, that the Directors themſelves protect them, and often go
Sharers with them.</p>
            <p>The Officers of the Company that are in <hi>Europe,</hi> are no
leſs attentive to enrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and I have been informed, that the
Directors who are employ'd in buying Goods, and have the Inſpection of all
Veſſels, or their <pb n="183" facs="tcp:56197:101"/>Rigging and Proviſions, or who
are employ'd in managing any other Affair, find always Ways and Means
conſiderably to augment their Salary and Fortune.</p>
            <p>But nothing ſo much hinders the good Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomy of the Company, as
chooſing Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors out of the Magiſtrates, when by their Eſtabliſhment
they were to be all Merchants or Tradeſmen, without any Employment in the
Publick, or more particular Government of the State; nevertheleſs, when there
is a Director's Office vacant, the Magiſtrates are always intrieguing for the
Authority and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary which they know are annexed to ſuch Office.</p>
            <p>Of the ſeventeen Places that the Town of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> has
in diſpoſal, there are twelve poſſeſſed by thoſe Gentlemen, who
having otherwiſe Employment enough, have not time to attend the Buſineſs
of the Company, which requires a particular Application and Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The
other Sharers have often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of theſe Abuſes, but without any
Remedy.</p>
            <p>I ſhall inſert at the End of this Treatiſe, a curious Piece,
which will give great Light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Dutch Eaſt-India</hi> Trade.</p>
            <p>It is a faithful Report of One, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Fleet from the
<hi>Indies</hi> in the Year 1688, which he made to the States-General, 
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:56197:102"/>touching the Poſture of the Company's Affairs in the
<hi>Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am principally moved to make this ſecret and important Piece
publick, to juſtify, in ſome Meaſure, what I have ſaid in Relation to
the <hi>Indian</hi> Trade (if any one doubt of the Truth of it,) tho' the
<hi>Dutch</hi> take all imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Care to hide and keep ſecret every thing
that relates to their Trade in the <hi>Indies,</hi> and which paſſes with
them for a Secret of State.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XV. Of the Trade of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company in the

            </head>
            <p>AFTER having ſpoken of the Trade the <hi>Dutch</hi> have in the
<hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> I ſhall finiſh this Treatiſe of Commerce with
what Trade the <hi>Indian</hi> Company have on the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern Coaſt of
<hi>America</hi> and other Places.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Portugueze</hi> were Maſters of all the Trade of theſe
Coaſts, and all the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Iſlands, by reaſon of the Forts they
cauſed to be built there, after they had made a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of that Country,
in finding out a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philip</hi> the Second, as I obſerved before, coming to the
Crown of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and having <pb n="185" facs="tcp:56197:102"/>in ſome manner
forbidden that State, as well as <hi>Spain,</hi> trading with the
<hi>Dutch,</hi> the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Part of the moſt ſubſtantial Merchants, who
ſaw themſelves out of Employment by this Prohibition, reſolved to go and
trade up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Coaſts of <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> and the
neighbouring Iſlands.</p>
            <p>The Village of <hi>Moure,</hi> on the Golden Coaſt, was the
firſt Place the <hi>Dutch</hi> had leave to trade in; and they knew ſo well
how to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage that Advantage, that in a very little time that Village became a
Place very conſiderable for Traffick; the <hi>Africans,</hi> who agreed
better with theſe new Traders than with the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueze,</hi> flocked
thither from all Parts.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> Trade at length encreaſed ſo conſiderably
all along the Coaſt of <hi>Guinea,</hi> that before the Truce of the Year
1609, it em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd above 20 large Veſſels, beſides above 100 of ſmaller
Burthen, that were conſtantly employ'd in the Trade of <hi>Cape Verde</hi>
and the Coaſts of <hi>America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Portugueze</hi> not being able to ſuffer that any one
ſhould partake of this Trade be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides themſelves, forgot nothing that
might exclude the <hi>Dutch,</hi> even to put a Price upon their Heads.</p>
            <p>They, on the other Hand, to ſecure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from theſe
Perſecutions of the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueze,</hi> in the Year 1612, built, with Leave
of the King of <hi>Sabon,</hi> a Fort near the Village <pb n="186" facs="tcp:56197:103"/>
               <hi>Moure,</hi> call'd Fort <hi>Naſſau;</hi> and ſince that,
their Trade went on with great Security and Quiet.</p>
            <p>Some ſmall time after their <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany was
ſettled, having a great deal of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and Seamen unemploy'd, they began to
talk of trading to the <hi>Weſt-Indies;</hi> which Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe was
occaſined by the <hi>Memoirs</hi> of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Merchant, whoſe Name was
<hi>John Fleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinguen,</hi> preſented to the States-General, who were
divided in their Opinions thereupon: But thoſe who wiſhed for Peace,
believing that an Eſtabliſhment of the <hi>Dutch</hi> in <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica</hi>
would raiſe invincible Obſtacles, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the Execution of that
Project.</p>
            <p>The Truce of twelve Years, which they made with <hi>Spain</hi> in
the Year 1609, expiring in the Year 1621, they began to revive that Project;
and the States-General having appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it, they regulated every thing that
might any wiſe have relation to the Eſtabliſhment of the New
<hi>Weſt-India</hi> Company, in hopes that their Republick might reap no
leſs Benefit and Advantage by this, than they had by the
<hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company; and all theſe Regulations were made and
reſolved upon the 20th Day of <hi>June,</hi> in the ſame Year 1621.</p>
            <p>This New General Company, which was ſet up on the Plan of that of
the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> was compoſed of ſeveral particular Companies,
that traded on the Coaſts of <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:56197:103"/>And there were ſeveral Subjects of
<hi>Spain</hi> that entered into the Company under borrow'd Names.</p>
            <p>The Funds of this Company were 7200000 Livres, and none but the
Company, excluſive of all the reſt of the Subjects of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
could, during the ſpace of 24 Years, trade on the Coaſts of
<hi>Africa,</hi> from the Tropick of <hi>Cancer</hi> to the <hi>Cape of Good
Hope;</hi> and thro all <hi>America,</hi> from the Streights of
<hi>Magellan</hi> to <hi>Newfoundland</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All the Members of this Company were divided into five Chambers, out
of which were choſen nineteen Perſons, to compoſe a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil to decide
all Controverſies and Matters of the greateſt Importance.</p>
            <p>The Progreſs this New Company made was ſo conſiderable, that
the States-General enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd great Hopes to make themſelves Maſters of
all the South Part of <hi>America.</hi> In ſhort, after thirteen Years War,
that Company ſaw themſelves Maſters of <hi>Brazil,</hi> the Provinces of
<hi>Fernambouc, Tamarica, Pariba</hi> and <hi>Rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grande,</hi> and there
ſettled a vaſt Trade, to the great Loſs and Detriment of the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Portugueze.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It appears by the Regiſters of the Company, that from the Year
1623, to the Year 1636, they had put to Sea 800 Veſſels on Account of War
and Trade, the Charge and Expence of which amounted to 45000000 of Gulders, 
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:56197:104"/>only for the Shipping, the Rigging and other
neceſſary Furniture and Proviſions, and that they had taken from their
Enemies 545 Veſſels which they valued at 60 Millions, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Plunder, amounted to above 30 Millions.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Peter Hem</hi> had taken near the <hi>Hava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> the
<hi>Peru</hi> Fleet, aboard which he found Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Millions of Silver, beſides
other Goods, Cannon and Stores which amounted to above Ten Millions, and that
the Loſſes the Enemy ſuſtained and of which the Company could make no
Advantage, came to above 35 Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; one of their moſt conſiderable
Loſſes was that occaſioned by Monſieur <hi>C. Hermite</hi> on the
Coaſts of <hi>Peru,</hi> where he deſtroyed in the Port of <hi>Lima</hi> a
Fleet of 30 Men of War.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1636, the Directors of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany judging it proper to
ſend to <hi>Brazil</hi> a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Reputation to reſide there, choſe
the Count of <hi>Naſſau</hi> to whom they gave the ſame Power and
Authority as to the Governour Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the <hi>Eaſt-Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During the 8 Years of his Government, he added to the Conqueſts of
the Company thoſe of <hi>Siara, Sirigi,</hi> and <hi>Maragan:</hi> 14
Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in <hi>Brazil,</hi> the Company poſſeſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of
Seven.</p>
            <p>The Company likewiſe made themſelves Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Fort
<hi>St. George de la Minas,</hi> the Town of <hi>St. Paul de la Conde,</hi> and
the Iſland of <hi>St. Thomas</hi> on the Coaſt of <hi>Africa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:56197:104"/>In the Year 1640 they deſtroyed in Four
Battles ſucceſſively the Enemies Fleet, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Fourſcore
and Thirteen Men of War, which had on Board 1200 Mariners.</p>
            <p>You ſee what the Purſe of theſe Merchants has effected in
<hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Truce which the States General in the Year 1641, concluded with
the <hi>Portugueze</hi> who had withdrawn themſelves from under the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Government towards the End of the Year 1640, ſtopt the
Porgreſs of the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny which in ſome Meaſure was the cauſe of their
Ruine; for ſeeing all Things in Peace, they recalled their Governour General
into <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> in the Year 1644, and remitted all Power and Authority
into the Hands of Three Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Sieur de Hamet</hi> at
<hi>Amſterdam, De Baſis</hi> a Goldſmith at <hi>Harlem,</hi> and
<hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtrat</hi> a Carpenter of <hi>Middlebourg;</hi> Men whoſe Heads
were wonderfully well turned for trad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but very ill for Politicks as the
Event clearly made it appear. Theſe good Men who thought of nothing elſe
but how to encreaſe their Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and make Commerce flouriſh, ſold Arms
and Gunpowder to the <hi>Portugueze,</hi> on Account of thoſe extravagant
Prices they gave, and let the Fortifications of their ſtrongeſt Places fall
to ruine, neglected furniſhing them with Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition and Arms, and permitted
the Soldiers when ever they pleaſed to come into <hi>Europe,</hi> 
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:56197:105"/>on Purpoſe to leſſen the Expence of their
Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons.</p>
            <p>This ill Conduct and Negligence gave Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to the
<hi>Portugueze</hi> to retake from the <hi>Dutch</hi> all they had in
<hi>Brazil,</hi> by renewing the War.</p>
            <p>At laſt this War came to an End the Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Day of
<hi>Auguſt</hi> 1661, by the Mediation of the King of <hi>England,</hi> who
was to marry the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Portugal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this Treaty the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly quitted all
their Pretenſions to <hi>Brazil</hi> for a good round Sum the
<hi>Portugueze</hi> gave them, with Liberty that they might trade as Friends on
the Coaſts of <hi>Brazil,</hi> in the Ports of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> and their
Dependencies, and on Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that the <hi>Portugueze</hi> would regulate the
Price of Salt.</p>
            <p>There remained at that time to the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, only the Forts they had
on the Golden Coaſt and <hi>Cape Verde,</hi> for the <hi>Portugueze</hi> had
retaken the Iſland of <hi>St. Thomas,</hi> the Towns of <hi>St. Salvador</hi>
and <hi>St. Paul,</hi> the Iſlands of <hi>Cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zao</hi> and <hi>Tabaco,</hi>
and the new Country between <hi>Virginia</hi> and <hi>New-England</hi> which
was found out after the Loſs of <hi>Brazil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The extraordinary Expence the Company were at in the laſt
<hi>Brazil</hi> War, drained them to that Degree, that they who before equalled
the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company, were reduced to ſuch a Condition, that
they could not pay Six Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions <pb n="191" facs="tcp:56197:105"/>of Guilders, or
ſomewhat more, they had Occaſion to borrow upon Intereſt.</p>
            <p>The States General to preſerve the Trade of the <hi>African</hi>
Coaſts and the Places they there were in Poſſeſſion of, in the Year
1674 form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a new Company compoſed of the Old Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners or Sharers and their
Creditors, the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods they took and concerted pleas'd both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and this
ſecond Company having got a Fund of about Six Millions of Guilders, kept up
very well their Trade and Commerce, and got very conſiderable Sums.</p>
            <p>I ſhall give you here ſome little Idea of their Trade and
wherein it chiefly conſiſts.</p>
            <p>Of all the Nations in <hi>Europe,</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> are
thoſe who conſtantly have had the greateſt Trade on the Coaſts of
<hi>Africa,</hi> they have there two principal Eſtabliſhments, one at
<hi>Cape Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,</hi> and the other on the Golden Coaſt in
<hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the little Iſland of <hi>Goree</hi> near <hi>Cape Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,</hi>
they have the Forts of <hi>Gor</hi> and <hi>Naſſau,</hi> where there is a
very good Road and excellent Bay; this Port is of great Uſe and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to
them in the Trade to <hi>Cape Verde</hi> which is very conſiderable, but the
Eſtabliſhment on the Golden Coaſt is of much more Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, their
Trade there being now more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable and rich.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:56197:106"/>The two ſtrongeſt Forts, are Fort <hi>St
George de las Minas</hi> and Fort <hi>Naſſau,</hi> which are but 4 Leagues
diſtant from each other.</p>
            <p>The reſt are the Forts of <hi>Achem, Danubo, Acaro, Sama</hi> and
<hi>Bouten.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They Trade likewiſe to other Countries ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing along and beyond the
Golden Coaſt, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>The Kingdoms of <hi>Arden, Benin, Congo</hi> and
<hi>Angola.</hi>
               </item>
               <item> The chief Commodities are, Gold, Ivory, Slaves, Leather, Gums
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>Gold is found almoſt every where on the Coaſt between Fort
<hi>d' Arquin</hi> near the White <hi>Cape</hi> (belonging ſtill to the
<hi>Dutch</hi>) and the Golden Coaſt. The Inhabitants get ſome in their own
Country, and ſome from the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Provinces of <hi>Africa,</hi> but
there is no Place in all the Weſt where there are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and ſuch rich
Mines as on the Golden Coaſt, ſo called, by reaſon of the vaſt
Quantities of the fineſt Gold that is there produced, this Country being an
inexhauſtable Treaſury.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Golden Mines which made the Nations of
<hi>Europe</hi> eſtabliſh themſelves in thoſe Climates, by Means or
Favour of the ſeveral Forts they have cauſed there to be built, as the
<hi>Portugueze</hi> who were the firſt diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, the <hi>Engliſh,
Germans, French, Swedes, Danes,</hi> and <hi>Dutch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:56197:106"/>The Gold furniſhed by the Negores with, is
in Ingots, Bracelets, Beads, and other Toys, or elſe in Duſt; their Ability
to counterfeit and falſifie Gold is ſo great, that they know how to gild
tho' in Duſt, and frequently gild over ſmall Pieces of Copper; and that
ſo curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly that it is inpoſſible not to be cheated, unleſs you
ſtand very much upon your Guard.</p>
            <p>The Trade for Slaves is undoubtedly one of the moſt conſiderable
that the Merchants of <hi>Europe</hi> can make on theſe Coaſts, their
diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Degrees in goodneſs make the difference in their Price; thoſe of
<hi>Angola</hi> are look'd upon to be the ſtrongeſt, this Trade is the more
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable and important, becauſe without theſe Slaves 'tis
impoſſible all over <hi>America</hi> and the Iſlands to do any thing in
the Mines, or to manure the Ground, make Sugar and Tobacco.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> are the only People that deal in Negroes, the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> I believe do not concern themſelves about that Part of
Commerce, the <hi>French</hi> very little, and the <hi>Portugueze</hi> buy none
but for their Colonies in <hi>Brazil</hi> and their other Dominions in the
<hi>Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> are the People the <hi>Dutch</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
with theſe Slaves, and they have entred into ſeveral Treaties with one
another for that very Purpoſe to ſettle the Number they ought to be
furniſhed with, their Price and the Places where they ought to be delivered,
which ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally are <hi>St. George de las Minas,</hi> and on 
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:56197:107"/>the Coaſts of <hi>Guinea,</hi> or in the Iſland of
<hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>razao,</hi> near the Town of <hi>Cartagena</hi> in
<hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Article of Ox and Cow-hides, or Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is very conſiderable
at <hi>Cape Verde,</hi> all along that Coaſt to the River
<hi>Gambia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides theſe Commodities, there is likewiſe brought a great
deal of Wax from <hi>Cape Verde</hi> and <hi>Sierra-Lione,</hi> and other
Countries on that Coaſt; as alſo Gum-Arabick for Dying, and Oſtrich
Feathers.</p>
            <p>Next to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are the
greateſt Traders on theſe Coaſts.</p>
            <p>All thoſe different ſorts of Commodities that are brought to the
Negroes, do not ſell indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently alike; ſome are proper only for
<hi>Capa Verde,</hi> others for the Golden Coaſt, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers again for
<hi>Arden</hi> and <hi>Angola,</hi> and the Merchants ſort them
accordingly.</p>
            <p>But it is generally ſaid that the beſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, and moſt
gainful to be carried to thoſe Coaſts, are, Rock-Chryſtal, Coral and
Lace, but eſpecially Brandies.</p>
            <p>All the Inhabitants of the Coaſt of <hi>Guinea</hi> conſume
great Quantities of Linnen Cloth half worn, which they think much more
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient than the Callicoes of their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as keeping the Body more
cool; and the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſupply them with great Quantities at very high
Rates.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:56197:107"/>The <hi>Dutch</hi> Company are yet in
Poſſeſſion of ſome of the Iſlands; as, <hi>Curazao, Tabaco, Buenos
Aires, Doruba,</hi> and St. <hi>Martin,</hi> but in Partnerſhip with the
<hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The two firſt of theſe are the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, as having
each of them a Fort, and <hi>Curazao</hi> a good Harbour: The Trade of which
Iſland conſiſts in the Commodities of the Growth of the Place, as Sugars,
Wool, Ox and Cow-Hides.</p>
            <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>Curazao</hi> trade with the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> as I before obſerved, which makes
that Iſland of great Importance to the <hi>Dutch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I believe the other <hi>Dutch</hi> Colonies in <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica</hi>
have no great Matter of Commerce; and if I am not much deceived, the Fort of
<hi>Suri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam</hi> does not belong to the Company, tho' I believe they would
willingly buy it, but the Sharers of <hi>Zealand</hi> would never conſent to
it; but be that how it will, the <hi>Dutch</hi> have been Maſters of it ever
ſince the <hi>Engliſh</hi> delivered it up to them by the Treaty of
<hi>Breda.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Colony is very ſmall, the Inhabitants not daring to Manure
and Till the Ground out of Cannon-reach, for the wild <hi>Indians</hi> give
them no Quarter, becauſe they hang'd their Brother <hi>Indians;</hi> and, it
muſt be own'd, without much Reaſon or Juſtice.</p>

                     <p>A long and troubleſome Sickneſs which I have laboured under,
has hinder'd me, till now, of having the Honour of appearing before your High
Mightineſſes to pay my Duty, in giving you in Writing, with a due
Reſpect, a faithful Report of the State and Condition the General Company of
the <hi>United Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> in the <hi>Indies</hi> was in at the time I came
from thence, which was on the 19<hi>th</hi> Day of <hi>November,</hi> in the
Year 1686, when I left, I thank Heaven, the Affairs of that illuſtrious and
flouriſhing Company in as good a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as they could deſire.</p>
                     <p>To repreſent to your High Mightneſſes more particularly
the vaſt Extent of their Dominions, and the great Trade the <hi>India</hi>
Company has in theſe Parts, I ſhall obſerve that Order which an Affair of
this Nature requires. It is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry I ſpeak of every Place in
Particular, and that I lay before your High Mightineſſes, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Affairs, in which, I think, conſiſts the Advancement and Preſervation of
the ſtrong <pb n="197" facs="tcp:56197:108"/>and important Provinces of the
<hi>Eaſt,</hi> which certainly are the moſt beautiful, the richeſt, and
moſt gainful Conqueſts of the whole <hi>Indies.</hi>

            <div n="Banda" type="place">
               <head>BANDA.</head>
               <p>The long Poſſeſſion the Company has had of this Place, I
don't doubt has given your High-Mightineſſes (by ſeveral Accounts
tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to you) a clear Idea and Knowledge of its Situation and Extent;
ſo that I believe it will be needleſs to give thoſe Particulars here: I
ſhall, however, ſay, that it is a Place where the Company has almoſt
none, or very little Trade by Sale of Stuffs and other Goods, and I believe
never may have, the Country being ſmall and ſlenderly Peopled, ſo that
the Vent here is very inconſiderable; and as to the free Navigation, which is
the only Thing that can bring any Benefit to it, it cannot by any means be
granted them, but ought to be abſolutely forbidden them, on account of the
Frauds they are there daily guilty of.</p>
               <p>This Iſland produces now no more what is neceſſary for Life,
ſo that they are forced to ſend to that Place, every Year, from
<hi>Batavia,</hi> great Quantities of Proviſions and Neceſſaries; which,
according to my Opinion, ought to be conſidered as a Thing contributing
moſt to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure <pb n="198" facs="tcp:56197:109"/>the Poſſeſſion of that
Iſland; it being certain, that if any Enemy ſhould take it by ſurprize,
or otherwiſe, as it might pleaſe God to permit, they would ſoon find
themſelves unprovided of all Neceſſaries of Life, and conſequently be
forced to leave it, unleſs they could conſtantly furniſh the Iſland
with ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Supplies.</p>
               <p>Any one may ſee by this true Account, what Advantage the Company
can have in trading to this Iſland; and if the Company exports ſome few
Commodities from ſome ſmall Farms, yet all that will not near anſwer the
Charges they are oblig'd to be at, to keep up and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the Works; and
theſe Expences amount every Year to very conſiderable Sums.</p>
               <p>But then if you put in Balance with theſe Expences, the great
Profit that the Mace and Nutmegs which the Company tranſports thence to
<hi>Europe,</hi> and even to other Parts of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> the Thing
will have another Face, and ſhow how important and advantagious that
Conqueſt is to the Company.</p>
               <p>The laſt Shipping that were ſent thither, according to the
yearly Cuſtom, to carry ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Proviſions, and bring thence Spices,
had a very happy and ſucceſsful Voyage, and return'd, at ſeveral times,
to the Harhour of <hi>Batavia,</hi> with a reaſonable Lading of Mace and
Nutmegs.</p>

                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:56197:109"/>The Advice we had from time to time,
aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd us, that the Affairs of the Company continued to be in a very good
and quiet Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and that the Spices grew as well as they could wiſh;
but then thoſe ſame Advices brought an Account, that they had ſeveral
Earthquakes, which threw down and damag'd many Houſes, and to which theſe
Iſlands, by their mountainous Situation, lye expoſed.</p>
               <p>The neareſt place to <hi>Banda,</hi> is</p>

               <head>AMBOINA.</head>
               <p>This Place was formerly taken from the <hi>Portugueze</hi> by our
People, and we have the Propriety of it to this Day, which makes the Company
the only Maſters of the Cloves, that are every Year gathered in this
Iſland, and which are delivered to the Company at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain fixed Price; and
the Company are oblig'd to take the whole Crop, how great ſoever it be;
whence it often happens, that Company is ſupplied with much more than they
can have vent for; by which it appears, that this Iſland produces more Cloves
than can be ſold or conſumed the whole World over; and 'tis for this
Reaſon that it is now thought no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er neceſſary to oblige the
<hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>Amboina</hi> to plant a certain Number of young Trees
eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Year, as heretofore they were want to do; and that Cuſtom has been
laid aſide for many Years.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:56197:110"/>It appears by the laſt Letters that came
from thence, that the Company's Ships arrived ſafely at that Place; and that
there Peace and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity reigned, that the Iſlanders indeed had received
ſome Damage by Fires, at ſeveral times, but that they had given Orders for
the future, to prevent the like Inconveniences.</p>
               <p>This Iſland and its Fort are very much more expoſed to
Attacks, than <hi>Banda,</hi> not only on Account of its Extent, but alſo
becauſe there are above threeſcore Thouſand Men, beſides Pira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and
other Inconveniences, which they are almoſt continually expoſed to from the
neighbouring Iſlands? ſo that according to my Judgment, I ſhould think it
abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to provide very ſoon, and that too with the
greateſt Caution, the Peace and Quiet of of this little Province, and its
Inhabitants, as one of the moſt important Poſſeſſions the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
has in the <hi>Indies.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Batavia</hi> is obliged to furniſh this Country with
Neceſſaries for Subſiſtance of Life, in the ſame manner as the
Iſland of <hi>Banda;</hi> for the Inhabitants are ſo lazy, it is almoſt
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to make them plow; and as there is but a very little Trade
there for Linen, and and other Clothing, the Expences the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are at to
ſupport them, amount to much more than the Gain they can make by the Sale of
ſuch Commodities in that Iſland; but then the Vent they have for their
Cloves, which <pb n="201" facs="tcp:56197:110"/>is very great, overpays that Charge with
vaſt Advantage, the Profits accruing thereby being ſix times more than the
Expence of ſupporting that Province amounts to.</p>

               <p>This Place muſt be conſidered no otherwiſe than as a
Frontier Town of the principal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment beforementioned, the Company be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
obliged to pay the King, and the chief Lords of his Court, a certain Sum in
Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for having heretofore conſented, that all the Clove Trees in
their Dominions ſhould be plucked up.</p>
               <p>By the laſt Advices from <hi>Batavia,</hi> and by the verbal
Report of the Sieur <hi>Lobs,</hi> who was Governour, we were informed, that
our People lived quietly, and in good Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with the Natives, and
that the Conduct of the King ſince the Company had ſo graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
reſtored him to his Throne, was as they could wiſh.</p>
               <p>There were great Complaints made, that ſome Servants of the
Company were much wanting in their Fidelity, that they were very negligent, and
unqualified for their ſeveral Employments, which was very prejudicial to the
Company. This is a Diſtemper which has <pb n="202" facs="tcp:56197:111"/>ſome time
ſince infected almoſt all the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the Company in the
<hi>Indies,</hi> and the Conſequences will be very fatal, if they do not take
proper Meaſures to remedy theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Abuſes; for Fidelity and
Diligence in Servants, joined with Experience, and a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Knowledge of
Management of Affairs, are, after the Bleſſing of God, the principal
Pillars of this great Edifice of Trade; they ought therefore to be maintained
and encouraged, as much as poſſible, to bring Commerce to its utmoſt
Height, which cannot otherwiſe ever poſſibly be effected.</p>
               <p>There is a great Conſumption in this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, of coarſe
Linnen; but the Profits ariſing thereby, and other Incomes, are not any ways
proportioned to the Charge the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are at: The Returns are hardly worth
men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning. The Tortoiſe Shell of this Place is as good a Commodity as can
be deſired, and very profitable; but the Quantities are ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſmall,
that the two Companies, and their Servants do not find their Account in it; and
it is much the ſame with</p>

               <p>In this Place the Company has a good Fort well ſupplied with
Ammunition, and of great Strength, and keeps there a good Garriſon, which is
very neceſſary to awe thoſe hardy <pb n="203" facs="tcp:56197:111"/>and warlike
People, and hinder them from attacking us at unawares, and driving us out of
the Country. The Reaſons that engaged the Company to make War againſt the
<hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſarians,</hi> was the greatneſs of the Kings of that Country,
their Power which encreaſed daily, and their underhand Workings againſt the
Company's Intereſt; inſomuch that they were in perpetual Anxiety how to
preſerve their Poſſeſſions in thoſe Kingdoms: And as the frequent
Murders and Robberies that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion committed, as well on the Officers and
Servants of the Company, as their Friends and Allies, gave them more than
ſufficient Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to take up Arms againſt thoſe People; ſo the
Company were not backward to ſend a ſtrong Power againſt them, and the
Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king proved ſo ſucceſsful, that that Nation which was once ſo
powerful, was conquered, and forced to accept of Peace from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany on
ſuch Conditions as they would give them; and by this means the Fort was
ſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and that Poſſeſſion, together with the Change of the
Government of <hi>Macaſſar,</hi> has put that Nation entirely out of
Condition to undertake any thing againſt the Company, ſo that they are very
eaſy on that Point.</p>
               <p>If the Directors, and proper Servants of the Company, had not been
negligent in keeping the Balance of Power, which was very pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently and
opportunely put into their Hands, <pb n="204" facs="tcp:56197:112"/>by the Diviſion of
Territories, and by the Eſtabliſhment of <hi>Radia Polacha,</hi> who is now
become ſo powerful by that Negligence of the Servants of the Company, that at
preſent they have reaſon to diſtruſt, and be afraid of him.</p>
               <p>In this Iſland there is a conſiderable Trade for Linen, and
other Goods; and it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, if the Company could engroſs the whole Trade
of that Country, excluſive of all other Traders (amongſt which may be
reckoned the Commiſſaries themſelves) the Gains they would then have,
would be more than ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to defray the Expences they are every Year
obliged to bear, and which, at preſent, are more than the Profits, including
the Income of the Corn the Company cauſed to be ſown there.</p>

               <p>We have here a Caſtle, but ſmall, and of little Conſequence,
however, it is well ſituated for the Company's Trade, which yet is not
ſufficient to ſupply the Store-houſe they have cauſed to be here ſet
up: They keep it for the Convenience of ſelling of Slaves not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,

               <p>This is a Country of a large Extent, and well inhabited. Our
People live in the capital Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, where there are very few Commiſſaries,
and thoſe moſt of them employed in Writing to take care of the Trade, which
conſiſts prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally in Deer Skins brought hither from <hi>Japan</hi> to
be ſold, and in Tin, which the Company cauſes to be bought at

The Callicoes from <hi>Coromandel</hi> go off ſoon in this Kingdom, and the
Company brings thither very little elſe. The Reaſon chiefly is, the 
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:56197:113"/>Carriage of theſe Callicoes into this Kingdom, which is
made by the free Trade and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication the Moors of <hi>Coromandel</hi> have
with thoſe of <hi>Siam,</hi> to whom they bring theſe Goods, and ſell
them very cheap to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Siam,</hi> who have them by theſe means
at the firſt Hand, and this makes the Commiſſaries of the Company ſell
them at the ſame Price as the Moors; ſo that it muſt not be expected we
ſhall drive on any conſiderable Trade in <hi>Siam:</hi> However, the
Magazine there is of much Uſe and Advantage to the Company, and it was on
that Account they were reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to give all poſſible Satisfaction to the
Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador the King of <hi>Siam</hi> ſent expreſsly to
<hi>Batavia,</hi> to determine ſome Diſputes, who was afterwards ſent
back very well ſatisfied, in one of the Company's Ships. In a Voyage made

of <hi>Bavea</hi> on a Rock, and ſunk the next Day to the Bottom; but by good
For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, all the Cargo was ſaved, and brought up the River
<hi>Palinbourg,</hi> in Shalloops.</p>
               <p>The Company's Affairs, at the time of my coming away from the

time after, they laid a new Tax upon as worſe than the firſt; that is, they
limited our Trade with them to that Degree, that we ſhould deal with them for
no more than what only would amount to a certain Sum, and that certain Sum was
fixed to three Hundred Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſannd Failes a Year, which cannot any ways be
ſufficient to procure us ſo much Profit only, as is abſolutely
neceſſary to defray the great Expences, and other Charges that the

Preſents they muſt give for Maintenance of their Shipping, and the

               </p>
               <p>Many are of Opinion, that this Limitation of Commerce was
principally intented to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt the <hi>Chineſe,</hi> who came about
that time into <hi>Japan,</hi> with great Numbers of ſmall Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels full
of People, amongſt whom were ſeveral <hi>Tartars</hi> that had a warlike
Countenance, which created in the <hi>Japoneſe</hi> ſufficient Diſtruſt
and <pb n="209" facs="tcp:56197:114"/>Suſpicion. They were afraid, that the
<hi>Tartars</hi> who had been a long while before Maſters of all
<hi>China,</hi> and by that means, in a Condition of undertaking great
Conqueſts, had formed ſome Deſign againſt their Country, on Account of
its happy Climate, and fine Situation; and that they had an Intention to land a
great Number of Men, under Pretence of trading with them. To prevent theſe
Inconvenience, without letting any one know what were their Views and Motives,
the <hi>Japaneſe</hi> made this <hi>hard</hi> Regulation, which they notified
accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly to the <hi>Chineſe,</hi> that they might not for the time to
come, bring into <hi>Japan,</hi> a greater Quantity of Goods than they ought,
and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Value of the Sum regulated: And the better to hide this real
Motive of theirs from the <hi>Chineſe,</hi> and that they ſhould not think
this Prohibition was directly levelled at them, they included <hi>us</hi>
likewiſe, tho' they gave us verbal Promiſes, that it ſhould only be for a

with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a vaſt Prejudice to themſelves, to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue their Commerce with

the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany's Intereſt is to live in Peace, and not break with a People,
from whom they gain ſuch conſiderable Advantages in Trade, which they would
run the hazard of loſing, ſhould they take up Arms to maintain the

'twill be better to let things reſt as they are: This Method to me ſeems

               <p>By the laſt Advices from <hi>Bengal,</hi> before we left the

Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurnantie</hi> and <hi>Golconda,</hi> for the Advancement of Trade in
thoſe ſeveral Places, which conſiſts chiefly in Callicoes; as alſo in
the Sale of ſeveral Commodities our People bring into thoſe Parts, as
Spices, <hi>Japan</hi> Copper, Tin, Gold Ore, and the like. This Trade is
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely profitable and advantageous, but yet expoſed to the Violence of
the <hi>Moors</hi> that are in Power; for the Governments of theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
are almoſt always farmed; and theſe Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers being protected by the
Miniſtry, take all Opportunities to extort Money from the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
inſomuch that Foreign Dealers can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſecure themſelves from being
pillaged by theſe Farmers, who are very covetous; and therefore to avoid
being diſturbed in their Traffick, are forced to skreen themſelves from
theſe Evils by Preſents, which coſts the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany very dear. But theſe
Evils are unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily much augmented ſince about four Years ago, and arrived
to that Exceſs, as obliged the Company to take up Arms, and ſeize upon the
Town of <hi>Mazulipatam,</hi> to force the King of <pb n="219" facs="tcp:56197:119"/>
                  <hi>Golconda</hi> to give them juſt Satisfaction for the Violence
and Injuries done the Company, which in the End came to a very good
Iſſue.</p>
               <p>The Occaſion of this Difference was thus: The Reſident of the
Company in <hi>Golconda,</hi> which is the City where the King reſides,
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Security for a certain Pagan Merchant, for the Value of a Million of
Livres, without having any Order or Power to do ſo, and which was done
without doubt in View of ſome conſiderable Intereſt and Advantage; the
Firſt Miniſter of the Kingdom, who was alſo a Pagan of the Race of
<hi>Brammer,</hi> took this Opportunity to make his Market; impriſon'd the
Merchant, and ſeiz'd on all his Effects, under Pretence that he was indebted
to the King in vaſt Sums of Money: Our People ſaw very well how
ill-grounded this Pretence was, and repreſented accordingly the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
made with the Company, that no Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant whom the Company dealt with ſhould
be moleſted, either in his Perſon or Goods, and that the Company were not
previouſly ſatisfied their Demands they had on thoſe Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants; but all
ſignified nothing, and they were obliged to take up Arms; and Matters were
carried ſo far, that the King engaged himſelf to pay this Debt out of his
own Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues; and thus the Company obtained by Force that Satisfaction they
were denied, and freed themſelves in a little time from a long 
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:56197:120"/>War which was very expenſive, and would have been very
prejudicial to them, by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting their Commerce with this Nation, the
moſt Important, and of the greateſt Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of any they have in the
<hi>Indies.</hi> The frequent Quibbles of the <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Governours, is
the Reaſon why the Company cannot drive a free Trade in that Country, but are
obliged to make theſe Trade-Contracts with ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Perſons, and
even to truſt them with the greateſt Part of their Commodities all at once,
becauſe of the Liberty and Eaſineſs with which they Sell or Truck with
the Natives of the Country, and much more advantageouſly than our People can
do. Theſe Dealers enter alſo into Societies amongſt themſelves, and
gain much more than our People; and this is one of the chief Reaſons that the
Company could not get theſe ſort of Contracts with the <hi>Mooriſh</hi>
Merchants executed, for vending their Linnens in <hi>Siam</hi> and other
Countries.</p>
               <p>The laſt Advices from <hi>Coromandel,</hi> told us that our

which would be more advantageous than the laſt, to the Trade of
<hi>Batavia,</hi> on Account of the great Privileges our People had obtained
from <hi>Suzan Honnan</hi> on the Eaſtern Coaſt of <hi>Java,</hi> in
acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Supplies that Prince receiv'd from the Company againſt
his Rebel Subjects, to quell which Rebellion coſt much Blood and Treaſure;
for it is no ſtrange thing, that Subjects ſo rebellious as they were,
ſhould do a great deal of Miſchief to the Trade of our People and the
Company, becauſe of thoſe great Conveniences of having ſuch a Number of
good Ports and Havens all along the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern Coaſt, and by the vaſt Gain
they there made, which induced them to cheat us as much as poſſibly they
could.</p>
               <p>Experience has ſhewn us, that the too great Extent of our
Territories, and the too great Number of Maritime Places we have in the
<hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> are ever attended with immenſe Charges, ſolid and
always certain Expences at all times, whereas the Profits they bring are
caſual and very uncertain; which makes me believe, that in time the farther
we go, the more clearly ſhall we ſee that the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact
Poſſeſſions are ever the beſt and moſt <pb n="228" facs="tcp:56197:124"/>profitable; and beſides, are more ſure to be kept, leſs envied,
and leſs ſubject to Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and give leſs Trouble and Vexation to
thoſe who govern them; particularly if their Neighbours are warlike and
perfidious: The Truth of this we have lately ſeen in the Caſe of Monſieur
<hi>Tack,</hi> Ambaſſador of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, who departed for his Embaſſy
attended with a good Number of Soldiers for that Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. No Body doubts but
Prince <hi>Honnan,</hi> whom I juſt now mentioned, was guilty of that
Violence, which is certainly a Piece of the greateſt Perfidiouſneſs, and
the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful Return, from a Prince who ow'd to the Company (under
God) his Life and Crown. This Misfortune may always ſerve as a Leſſon to
our People for their future Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in like Caſes. Our Troops which were
ſent to thoſe Parts to have Satisfaction for that Outrage, and to bring
thoſe Infidels to Reaſon, were ſtill at <hi>Japura,</hi> without being
able to do any thing; <hi>Sourapary</hi> then Chief having retired out of the
Territories of <hi>Java,</hi> into a Country whither 'twas impoſſible to
follow him without Danger, it being to be feared, we ſhould have a long War
on that ſide, which would be a prodigious Expence, and very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to
the Company and their Trade.</p>

time before it was deſigned to be put in Execution by a great many of thoſe
Villains; ſo that that Deſign was not only prevented, but rooted entirely
up by the Death of ſome of thoſe principal Traytors; and the King judged it
proper, to prevent the like for the future, to ſend the old King his Father
(who was then Priſoner at <hi>Bantan,</hi> and ſuſpected to be acquainted
with this pernicious Deſign.) to <hi>Batavia,</hi> to be ſecured in the

                     <p>THESE are the principal Things relating to the preſent

                     <p>I have only this to add, that after living there thirty five
Years, I have at laſt obtained my being recalled from the Eaſt
<hi>Indies,</hi> upon my repeated Inſtances, that I may return to my dear

and came to Anchor the firſt of <hi>December</hi> following before
<hi>Bantan,</hi> this Place being appointed for us to wait for the Books and
Papers, which could not be got ready before we ſet Sail, and which came to us
the 25<hi>th</hi> Day of the ſame Month. But as the Harveſt of the Weſt
was then paſt, we were forced to ſtruggle againſt Wind and Tide in the
Streights of the <hi>Sonde,</hi> with a great deal of Danger, till the
4<hi>th</hi> of <pb n="231" facs="tcp:56197:125"/>
                        <hi>January,</hi> 1697, when we happily
paſſed the Streights of <hi>Java,</hi> and <hi>Prince Iſland,</hi> and
ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in open Sea, continuing our Voyage with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Inconveniency, or
Stop, till we arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at the Cape of <hi>Good Hope,</hi> where we happily came
to Anchor, the 20<hi>th</hi> and 21<hi>ſt</hi> Day of <hi>March,</hi> in the
ſame Year 1697, with all our Veſſels, and with them four other that came
from the Iſle of <hi>Ceylan,</hi> viz. <hi>The Iſle Schonen, Peviſland,
Woorſchotten,</hi> and <hi>Languervich.</hi> We likewiſe found in that
Road, the <hi>Alkmaar</hi> and <hi>Creſſembourg,</hi> which happily arrived
from <hi>Coromandel,</hi> and waited for us a long while at the Cape: Some
little time after, we ſaw come into that Road, the Fleet
<hi>Meſmeleheder,</hi> from <hi>Bengal,</hi> conſiſting of 13
Veſſels.</p>
                     <p>I can aſſure your High Mightineſſes, that the Port of
the Cape is very well ſituated, and as important as neceſſary, both for
thoſe Ships that go to, and thoſe that return from the <hi>Indies:</hi> It
is a ſure Refuge, and a very convenient Place for refitting and cleaning
Shipping, and to furniſh them with all neceſſary Proviſions: The Air is
extremely wholeſome, and here the ſick recover their Health. Here are all
Sorts of good Herbs and Fruits in Abundance, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Beef and Mutton, and in
vaſt Plenty; and by the Care of the preſent Governour, there is a vaſt
Increaſe of both theſe Sorts of Cattel, and the Earth ſo well manured,
that this Place at preſent can ſubſiſt with its own Corn, and 
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:56197:126"/>niſh its Inhabitants with neceſſary Proviſions
without any foreign Aſſiſtance, and is in hopes in a little time to have
ſuch Quantities, as may alſo ſupply other Places. It is great Pity that
ſo large and fertile a Country, ſituated in a very happy Climate, ſhould
be almoſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inhabited, where Millions of Souls might very conveniently
ſubſiſt, as being in a Place abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with all Neceſſaries of Life,
and where they might mutually aſſiſt each other.</p>
                     <p>We ſtaid there till the 9th of <hi>April,</hi> in the ſame
Year 1697, when we ſailed with a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Wind from <hi>Tafel-Bay;</hi> we
accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly paſſed the great Ocean, and had the good Fortune to finiſh
our Voyage very ſucceſsfully without any unhappy Accident at all; this was
on the 17th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> in the Year 1698 when we arrived in this
Country with the whole Fleet, and the ſame Day every Veſſel came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Port they were ordered to, with the greateſt and richeſt Return that
ever came from the <hi>Indies</hi> into this Country; for which Bleſſing I
ſhall never ceaſe giving Praiſe and Thanks to the Almighty, and beſeech
him that he would encreaſe the Honour and Glory of the Republick, and this
illuſtrious and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Company, that it would pleaſe Him to take it into
his Holy Protection, and encreaſe its Commerce more and more in all the
